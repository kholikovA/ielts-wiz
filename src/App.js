          <>
            I prefer keeping my cat indoors, mainly because I live in a flat and don't really have outdoor space. Plus, I think indoor pets tend to <Vocab word="bond" meaning="form a close emotional connection">bond</Vocab> more with their owners since they're always around. She does have access to a small balcony though, which she absolutely loves.

There's something incredible about how intelligent they are and the way they look after each other. I visited a sanctuary in Thailand a few years ago, and honestly, it <Vocab word="blew my mind" meaning="amazed or impressed me greatly">blew my mind</Vocab>.

            Yeah, I grew up with a golden retriever called Max who was basically my <Vocab word="childhood companion" meaning="a close friend during early years of life">childhood companion</Vocab>. We got him when I was about seven, and he was around until I went to uni. Now I've got a rescue cat, and while it's a different <Vocab word="vibe" meaning="feeling or atmosphere">vibe</Vocab>, it's equally rewarding.

            I actually had a long weekend about two weeks ago when there was a public holiday. I <Vocab word="tacked on" meaning="added something extra to the end">tacked on</Vocab> a Monday as well, so I got four days to properly <Vocab word="unwind" meaning="relax after stress or tension">unwind</Vocab>.

            It depends on my mood, really. Sometimes I just <Vocab word="veg out" meaning="relax completely, doing very little">veg out</Vocab> and binge-watch shows, but other times I'll go hiking or plan a <Vocab word="day trip" meaning="a journey to a place and back in one day">day trip</Vocab> somewhere.

            Oh, I'd probably start with a <Vocab word="leisurely" meaning="relaxed and unhurried">leisurely</Vocab> breakfast at this café I've been meaning to try.

            A bit of both, actually. My parents live about an hour away, so I try to visit them at least once or twice a month, usually for Sunday lunch. With friends, it's more <Vocab word="spontaneous" meaning="happening naturally without planning">spontaneous</Vocab> – we might just <Vocab word="grab brunch" meaning="casually meet for a late morning meal">grab brunch</Vocab> or do something on a whim.

Thai and Vietnamese are probably my <Vocab word="go-to" meaning="favourite or most relied upon choice">go-to</Vocab> cuisines. I also love Japanese food – not just sushi, but the whole range from ramen to little <Vocab word="izakaya" meaning="Japanese-style casual bar serving food and drinks">izakaya</Vocab> dishes.

But Korean food has become <Vocab word="massive" meaning="extremely popular">massive</Vocab> recently, particularly among younger people – you'll find Korean BBQ places everywhere now.

I've tried it stir-fried, in soups, even stuffed with meat, but my <Vocab word="taste buds" meaning="sensory organs on the tongue for tasting">taste buds</Vocab> just reject it. I'm also not <Vocab word="keen on" meaning="not enthusiastic about">keen on</Vocab> really strong cheeses, though I keep trying them hoping I'll <Vocab word="come around" meaning="gradually change opinion to accept something">come around</Vocab> eventually.

I stepped out to take the rubbish out, and the door <Vocab word="swung shut" meaning="closed quickly with a swinging motion">swung shut</Vocab> behind me with my keys on the counter. I was standing there in my pyjamas at 9pm, totally <Vocab word="mortified" meaning="extremely embarrassed">mortified</Vocab>.

            It really depends on your relationship with them. I've <Vocab word="swapped" meaning="exchanged">swapped</Vocab> spare keys with the couple next door, and it gives me <Vocab word="peace of mind" meaning="a feeling of calm and security">peace of mind</Vocab> knowing someone I trust has access in emergencies.

I've only got three keys: flat, my parents' house for emergencies, and my bike lock. <Vocab word="Bulky" meaning="large and difficult to carry">Bulky</Vocab> keychains are so uncomfortable in your pocket! I've also switched to <Vocab word="keyless entry" meaning="system allowing access without physical keys">keyless entry</Vocab> where I can, which has <Vocab word="streamlined" meaning="made simpler and more efficient">streamlined</Vocab> things a lot.

            I'm a bit <Vocab word="sceptical" meaning="having doubts about something">sceptical</Vocab> about universal dream symbolism, like the idea that water always means the same thing for everyone. I think dreams are pretty personal, so their meanings depend on your own experiences.

            It really depends on how they tell it. Dreams can be <Vocab word="fascinating" meaning="extremely interesting">fascinating</Vocab> if the person shares the emotional impact or finds humour in the absurdity. But when someone <Vocab word="rambles on" meaning="talks for a long time without clear purpose">rambles on</Vocab> about every random detail, it gets a bit tedious, to be honest.

I might share an amusing one with colleagues over lunch, or mention a recurring <Vocab word="anxiety dream" meaning="a dream reflecting worries or fears">anxiety dream</Vocab> to close friends.
