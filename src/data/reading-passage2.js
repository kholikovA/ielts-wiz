    title: 'A study of western celebrity',
    subtitle: 'In our celebrity-obsessed culture, TV shows, internet blogs, and even newspapers are often full of the latest news, gossip and scandals about current celebrities',
    passage: `In our celebrity-obsessed culture, TV shows, internet blogs, and even newspapers are often full of the latest news, gossip and scandals about current celebrities\n<strong>A</strong> It seems that our current society cannot get enough information about the daily lives of celebrities. But how did celebrities become so much an important force in our culture? While people have always had shared a certain obsession for the fantastic and the famous, the notion of celebrity, as well as the types of people termed 'celebrities', has evolved greatly throughout the ages. The word 'celebrity' has its roots in the language of the ancient Roman civilization. The word we now know to mean 'a condition of being famous' or 'a famous person' is derived from the Latin word 'celeber', meaning 'frequented or populous'.\n<strong>B</strong> The celebrities of the ancient world were the powerful and awesome deities of Greece and Rome, and the citizens of these civilizations believed in a vast number of immortals who had a direct impact on their lives. It was, therefore, important to know about these figures' personal lives. This need to know led to the creation of myths, which personalized the gods and involved them in ancient celebrity scandals that thrilled and excited the common people.\n<strong>C</strong> During ancient times, amateur and professional athletes also began to make an impact on the celebrity culture. Victors in the ancient Olympic Games were treated as heroes and were often elevated to god-like status. In the ancient Roman civilization, gladiators — the equivalent of today's professional athletes — were also revered by the common people for their heroics and seemingly superhuman strength.\n<strong>D</strong> As Europe moved into the Dark Ages (the years spanning approximately 400—1300 AD) and a time when athletics and the arts were largely forgotten, monarchs and rulers continued to maintain celebrity status, while religious figures took on newfound fame. The miraculous lives and fascinating deaths of spiritual figures lent excitement to the lives of common people when there was often little else to be excited about, as they faced war, disease and food shortages.\n<strong>E</strong> During the period 1300—1600 AD, or the Renaissance period as it is known, interest in ruling figures faded. As Europe emerged from its long neglect of the arts, there was greater appreciation for portraits, statues and stone carvings. This period of appreciation for the arts lent a sense of celebrity to artists who were noted for their works and their personal achievements. It was a time when artists began to surpass political and religious individuals for supreme celebrity — a trend that would continue into later centuries.\n<strong>F</strong> While the figures of the ancient and early modern civilizations were able to achieve moderate and sometimes lasting celebrity within particular cultures, the global reach of their fame was limited. It was not until the 1700s, when technological advances made publishing commercially viable, that the extent of a person's fame could spread further. The increase in the availability of the written word was accompanied by a huge rise in the number of common people who could read, allowing a mass audience to find out about celebrities for the first time. Suddenly, the lives of authors, politicians, war heroes, and other celebrities could now be read about in newspapers around the world. These gave ordinary people the opportunity to become intimately knowledgeable about the figures they most admired.\n<strong>G</strong> In the modern are, particularly as radio and film took off in the 1900s, things really began to change. First, radio began to make its way into the average home in the 1920s and 1930s. Professional athletes also began to be regarded as stars, as their games and exploits could be broadcast over the air for an entirely new audience. Then, the rise of television in the 1950s only cemented the premier level of celebrity that film stars, athletes and television actors were beginning to share. This also meant a huge increase in the individual salaries of these celebrities. Even a few animals gained fame through children's TV shows. The emergence of reality television shows in the late 1990s allowed all kinds of people with little ability to enjoy a short burst of fame on the television screen. All you needed, it seemed, was an attractive appearance. Today, reality television programmers make it possible to be famous nor for doing anything in particular, but simply for being, with the audience deciding whether someone deserves to become a celebrity or not. As the meaning of celebrity continues to evolve and redefine itself in a quickly changing world, there is no telling who will become of interest next.`,

    subtitle: 'New ideas and some old ones',
    passage: `New ideas and some old ones\n<strong>A</strong> The traditional kampung houses of Malaysia do not need air-conditioning. Built on stilts and with steep roofs, they have year-round ventilation. The raised structure ensures a cooling breeze comes up through the floorboards, while the high roof acts as a chimney to release hot air. The airtight, concrete boxes of modern city construction, in contrast, are heat traps, says Muhammad Peter Davis of University Putra Malaysia. He has calculated that typical modern Malaysian houses are 5°C hotter than the air outside. The builders of kampung houses "had no knowledge of modern science or engineering but they came up with the perfect design," says Davis.\n<strong>B</strong> This story of ancient architectural sophistication and modern insanity is repeated around the world. In the name of modernism, people have thrown away architecture designed to cope with the environment in which they live, and adopted house designs originating from cold, northern environments, where the idea is to keep heat in.\n<strong>C</strong> Once, the aim of architectural modernists was to build structures that kept nature out and to replace it with air-conditioning. Now they are learning that they cannot do that effectively. Slowly, they are seeing the benefit of working with nature, rather than against it. In California, they probably use more power for air-conditioning than anywhere else on Earth. According to Arthur Rosenfeld from the University of California, what California needs is white paint. If Los Angeles painted its roofs white, planted trees to shade buildings, and chose lighter-colored paving, it could reduce city temperatures by 3°C and cut the annual air-conditioning bill by US$ 170 million a year.\n<strong>D</strong> Modern buildings are greedy in their use of energy. Much is made of the contribution of transportation to global warming, through its emissions of greenhouse gases. But, globally, transportation is responsible for just 22 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. The building sector is responsible for 31 per cent, mostly the result of heating and air-conditioning systems. In developing countries, where demand for electricity for buildings is rising by 5 per cent a year, the biggest demand is for air-conditioning in modern buildings which are often designed to cope with every different climatic condition.\n<strong>E</strong> Before air-conditioning, much of the Arab world kept cool through thoughtful building design. Many buildings were built according to the principles of the wind tower, a tall structure with vertical vents at the top that open in all directions to catch any passing breeze. Typically, these wind-tower buildings were made of local materials such as stone, mud brick, wood and palm-tree fronds. The buildings were inward-looking, which served the dual function of focusing attention on the courtyard, where family members spend time together, and protecting living areas from the rays of the sun.\n<strong>F</strong> Throughout the Middle East today, wind towers are often little more than museum pieces. But there are exceptions. Jordan has won awards for the architecture of a village on the shores of the Red Sea, which is designed to conserve energy. Made of rough, local stone in a traditional style, it combines the ventilation system of the wind towers for summer coolness with up-to-date heating and floor insulation to protect against the desert cold in winter.\n<strong>G</strong> Traditional building materials, like traditional building designs, are being rediscovered by those looking for low-energy solutions to the current construction needs. Clay is one such material: As the Dutch housing contractor R van der Ley has argued in promoting a series of clay housing projects in developing countries, clay has many benefits over its industrialized version, brick. Clay blocks cost only half as much as ordinary bricks. Clay also generates work because people can find it, mould it, bake it and work it themselves. Two hundred clay bricks can be made with the fuel oil that makes just one ordinary brick. Moreover, clay is an excellent insulator against both cold and heat outside, and can easily be recycled.\n<strong>H</strong> But although traditional methods and materials can be revived in appropriate settings, new green, low-energy technologies are needed, especially in urban environments. The thermal insulation of homes in cold countries is an example. In 1983, Sweden adopted a national standard, requiring the country’s homes to lose no more than 60 kilowatt-hours per square metre over the year. To meet that standard, windows were double-glazed, and walls and roofs insulated. Every home became a fortress against the cold air outside. Unfortunately, the rest of Europe has not followed the lead.\n<strong>I</strong> In the United States, Amory Lovins has promoted a range of low-energy technologies: 'super-windows', for example, which let in invisible light but can be ‘tuned’ to either allow in, or reflect away, infrared solar radiation - the stuff that heats. Buildings with large expanses of window (and big energy bills) can be designed to achieve optimum temperatures.\n<strong>J</strong> As well as more efficient use of energy, the world also needs new sources of renewable power. Solar energy is being tried out in the developing world, in villages often far from electricity grids. The world's biggest solar power installation got underway in the Philippines, in 2001, where a project commenced to install solar panels for 400,000 people in 150 villages. Such projects are demonstrating that countries, whether developing or developed, no longer need huge national grids to supply electricity. Every home can do its own thing with the help of a solar panel and a storage battery.\n<strong>K</strong> Houses, of course, are more than machines for living in. They are social and psychological spaces, too. Future houses may not look exactly like kampungs or wind towers or any other traditional models. But to work for us and for our environment, they will have to suit us as well as these traditional forms did.`,

    title: 'Are Artists Liars?',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Shortly before his death, Marlon Brando was working on a series of instructional videos about acting, to he called "Lying for a Iiving”. On the surviving footage, Brando can he seen dispensing gnomic advice on his craft to a group of enthusiastic, if somewhat bemused, Hollywood stars, including Leonardo Di Caprio and Sean Penn. Brando also recruited random people from the Los Angeles street and persuaded them to improvise (the footage is said to include a memorable scene featuring two dwarves and a giant Samoan). "If you can lie, you can act." Brando told Jod Kaftan, a writer for Rolling Stone and one of the few people to have viewed the footage. “Are you good at lying?” asked Kaftan. "Jesus." said Brando, “I'm fabulous at it".\n<strong>B</strong> Brando was not the first person to note that the line between an artist and a liar is a line one. If art is a kind of lying, then lying is a form of art, albeit of a lower order-as Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain have observed. Indeed, lying and artistic storytelling spring from a common neurological root-one that is exposed in the cases of psychiatric patients who suffer from a particular kind of impairment. Both liars and artists refuse to accept the tyranny of reality. Both carefully craft stories that are worthy of belief - a skill requiring intellectual sophistication, emotional sensitivity and physical self-control (liars are writers and performers of their own work). Such parallels are hardly coincidental, as I discovered while researching my book on lying.\n<strong>C</strong> A case study published in 1985 by Antonio Damasio, a neurologist, tells the story of a middle-aged woman with brain damage caused by a series of strokes. She retained cognitive abilities, including coherent speech, but what she actually said was rather unpredictable. Checking her knowledge of contemporary events, Damasio asked her about the Falklands War. In the language of psychiatry, this woman was “confabulating”. Chronic confabulation is a rare type of memory problem that affects a small proportion of brain damaged people. In the literature it is defined as "the production of fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive”. Whereas amnesiacs make errors of omission, there are gaps in their recollections they find impossible to fill - confabulators make errors of commission: they make tilings up. Rather than forgetting, they are inventing. Confabulating patients are nearly always oblivious to their own condition, and will earnestly give absurdly implausible explanations of why they're in hospital, or talking to a doctor. One patient, asked about his surgical sear, explained that during the Second World War he surprised a teenage girl who shot him three times in the head, killing him, only for surgery to bring him back to life. The same patient, when asked about his family, described how at various times they had died in his arms, or had been killed before his eyes. Others tell yet more fantastical tales, about trips to the moon, fighting alongside Alexander in India or seeing Jesus on the Cross. Confabulators aren’t out to deceive. They engage in what Morris Moseovitch, a neuropsychologist, calls “honest lying". Uncertain and obscurely distressed by their uncertainty, they are seized by a “compulsion to narrate": a deep-seated need to shape, order and explain what they do not understand. Chronic confabulators are often highly inventive at the verbal level, jamming together words in nonsensical but suggestive ways: one patient, when asked what happened to Queen Marie Antoinette of France, answered that she had been “suicided" by her family. In a sense, these patients are like novelists, as described by Henry James: people on whom "nothing is wasted". Unlike writers, however, they have little or no control over their own material.\n<strong>D</strong> The wider significance of this condition is what it tells us about ourselves. Evidently, there is a gushing river of verbal creativity in the normal human mind, from which both artistic invention and lying are drawn. We are born storytellers, spinning, narrative out of our experience and imagination, straining against the leash that keeps us tethered to reality. This is a wonderful thing; it is what gives us out ability to conceive of alternative futures and different worlds. And it helps us to understand our own lives through the entertaining stories of others. But it can lead us into trouble, particularly when we try to persuade others that our inventions are real. Most of the time, as our stories bubble up to consciousness, we exercise our cerebral censors, controlling which stories we tell, and to whom. Yet people lie for all sorts of reasons, including the fact that confabulating can be dangerously fun.\n<strong>E</strong> During a now-famous libel case in 1996, Jonathan Aitken, a former cabinet minister, recounted a tale to illustrate the horrors he endured after a national newspaper tainted his name. The case, which stretched on for more than two years, involved a series of claims made by the Guardian about Aitken's relationships with Saudi arms dealers, including meetings he allegedly held with them on a trip to Paris while he was a government minister. Whitt amazed many in hindsight was the sheer superfluity of the lies Aitken told during his testimony. Aitken’s case collapsed in June 1997, when the defence finally found indisputable evidence about his Paris trip. Until then, Aitken's charm, fluency and flair for theatrical displays of sincerity looked as if they might bring him victory, they revealed that not only was Aitken’s daughter not with him that day (when he was indeed doorstepped), but also that the minister had simply got into his car and drove off, with no vehicle in pursuit.\n<strong>F</strong> Of course, unlike Aitken, actors, playwrights and novelists are not literally attempting to deceive us, because the rules are laid out in advance: come to the theatre, or open this book, and we'll lie to you. Perhaps this is why we fell it necessary to invent art in the first place: as a safe space into which our lies can be corralled, and channeled into something socially useful. Given the universal compulsion to tell stories, art is the best way to refine and enjoy the particularly outlandish or insight till ones. But that is not the whole story. The key way in which artistic “lies" differ from normal lies, and from the "honest lying” of chronic confabulators, is that they have a meaning and resonance beyond their creator. The liar lies on behalf of himself; the artist tell lies on behalf of everyone. If writers have a compulsion to narrate, they compel themselves to find insights about the human condition. Mario Vargas Llosa has written that novels “express a curious truth that can only he expressed in a furtive and veiled fashion, masquerading as what it is not.” Art is a lie whose secret ingredient is truth.`,

    title: 'Bird Migration',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Birds have many unique design features that enable them to perform such amazing feats of endurance. They are equipped with lightweight, hollow bones, intricately designed feathers providing both lift and thrust for rapid flight, navigation systems superior to any that man has developed, and an ingenious heat conserving design that, among other things, concentrates all blood circulation beneath layers of warm, waterproof plumage, leaving them fit to face life in the harshest of climates. Their respiratory systems have to perform efficiently during sustained flights at altitude, so they have a system of extracting oxygen from their lungs that far exceeds that of any other animal. During the later stages of the summer breeding season, when food is plentiful, their bodies are able to accumulate considerable layers of fat, in order to provide sufficient energy for their long migratory flights.\n<strong>B</strong> The fundamental reason that birds migrate is to find adequate food during the winter months when it is in short supply. This particularly applies to birds that breed in the temperate and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where food is abundant during the short growing season. Many species can tolerate cold temperatures if food is plentiful, but when food is not available they must migrate. However, intriguing questions remain.\n<strong>C</strong> One puzzling fact is that many birds journey much further than would be necessary just to find food and good weather. Nobody knows, for instance, why British swallows, which could presumably survive equally well if they spent the winter in equatorial Africa, instead of several thousands of miles further to their preferred winter home in South Africa Cape Province. Another mystery involves the huge migrations performed by arctic terns and mudflat-feeding shorebirds that breed close to Polar Regions. In general, the further north a migrant species breeds, the further south it spends the winter. For arctic terns, this necessitates an annual round trip of 25,000 miles. Yet, en route to their final destination in far-flung southern latitudes, all these individuals overfly other areas of seemingly suitable habitat spanning two hemispheres. While we may not fully understand birds’ reasons for going to particular places, we can marvel at their feats.\n<strong>D</strong> One of the greatest mysteries is how young birds know how to find the traditional wintering areas without parental guidance. Very few adults migrate with juveniles in tow, and youngsters may even have little or no inkling of their parents’ appearance. A familiar example is that of the cuckoo, which lays its eggs in another species’ nest and never encounters its young again. It is mind-boggling to consider that, once raised by its host species, the young cuckoo makes its own way to ancestral wintering grounds in the tropics before returning single-handedly to northern Europe the next season to seek out a mate among its own kind. The obvious implication is that it inherits from its parents an inbuilt route map and direction-finding capability, as well as a mental image of what another cuckoo looks like. Yet nobody has the slightest idea as to how this is possible.\n<strong>E</strong> Mounting evidence has confirmed that birds use the positions of the sun and stars to obtain compass directions. They seem also to be able to detect the earth’s magnetic field, probably due to having minute crystals of magnetite in the region of their brains. However, true navigation also requires an awareness of position and time, especially when lost. Experiments have shown that after being taken thousands of miles over an unfamiliar landmass, birds are still capable of returning rapidly to nest sites. Such phenomenal powers are the product of computing several sophisticated cues, including an inborn map of the night sky and the pull of the earth’s magnetic field. How the birds use their ‘instruments’ remains unknown, but one thing is clear: they see the world with a superior sensory perception to ours. Most small birds migrate at night and take their direction from the position of the setting sun. however, as well as seeing the sun go down, they also seem to see the plane of polarized light caused by it, which calibrates their compass. Traveling at night provides other benefits. Daytime predators are avoided and the danger of dehydration due to flying for long periods in warm, sunlit skies is reduced. Furthermore, at night the air is generally cool and less turbulent and so conducive to sustained, stable flight.\n<strong>F</strong> Nevertheless, all journeys involve considerable risk, and part of the skill in arriving safely is setting off at the right time. This means accurate weather forecasting, and utilizing favorable winds. Birds are adept at both, and, in laboratory tests, some have been shown to detect the minute difference in barometric pressure between the floor and ceiling of a room. Often birds react to weather changes before there is any visible sign of them. Lapwings, which feed on grassland, flee west from the Netherlands to the British Isles, France and Spain at the onset of a cold snap. When the ground surface freezes the birds could starve. Yet they return to Holland ahead of a thaw, their arrival linked to a pressure change presaging an improvement in the weather.\n<strong>G</strong> In one instance a Welsh Manx shearwater carried to America and released was back in its burrow on Skokholm Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, one day before a letter announcing its release! Conversely, each autumn a small number of North American birds are blown across the Atlantic by fast-moving westerly tail winds. Not only do they arrive safely in Europe, but, based on ringing evidence, some make it back to North America the following spring, after probably spending the winter European migrants in sunny African climes.`,

    title: 'Why we love music',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, music is a purely abstract art form, devoid of language or explicit ideas. And yet, while listening to our favourite songs, our body betrays all the symptoms of emotional arousal. The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood pressure rise, the electrical conductivity of our skin is lowered, and the brain region associated with bodily movement becomes strangely active. Blood circulates to the muscles in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological roots.\nA recent paper in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> by a research team in Montreal, Canada, marks an important step in revealing the precise underpinnings of the technology in pleasurable musical listening. Although the study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ligand-based positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, the experiment itself was rather straightforward. After screening 217 individuals who responded to advertisements down the subject pool to ten. They then asked the subjects to bring in their playlist and played them – while their brain activity was monitored from techno to tango – and played them while their brain activity was monitored. Because the scientists used combining methods (PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively exact and detailed portrait of music in the brain. The first thing they discovered is that people's moods – by the neurons (nerve cells) in both the dorsal and ventral key role of the brain. As these two regions have long been linked with the experience of pleasure, this finding isn't particularly surprising.\nWhat is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine neurons in the caudate – a region of the brain involved in anticipating and other brain reward stimuli – were at their most responsive around 15 seconds before the participants' favourite moments in the music. The researchers call this the anticipatory phase and argue that the question, of course, is what all these dopamine neurons are up to. Why are they so active in the period preceding the acoustic climax? After all, we typically associate surges of dopamine with the processing of actual rewards. And yet, this pattern is still unresolved when the chills have yet to arrive and when the melodic pattern is still unresolved.\nOne way to answer the question is to look at the music and not the brain. While music can often seem (at least to the outsider) like a labyrinth of intricate patterns, it turns out that the most important part of every song or symphony is when the pattern breaks down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. If the music is too obvious, it is annoyingly boring, like an alarm clock. Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated that dopamine neurons quickly adapt to predictable rewards. If we know what's going to happen next, then we don't get excited. This is why composers often introduce a key note at the beginning of a song, spend most of the song avoiding it, and then finally repeat the greater emotional release when the pattern returns, safe and sound.\nTo demonstrate this psychological principle, the musicologist Leonard Meyer, in his classic book <em>Emotion and Meaning in Music</em> (1956), analyzed the 5th movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131. Meyer expects to show how Beethoven begins with the clear measures (bars) of the masterwork, showing how Beethoven begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern. He wants to preserve an element of uncertainty in his music, making our brains beg for the one chord he refuses to give us. Beethoven saves that chord for the end.\nAccording to Meyer, it is the suspenseful tension of music, arising out of unfulfilled expectations, that is the source can refer to the music's real world. While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound source of the music's feeling. While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound can refer to the music's real world images and experiences – its 'connotative' meaning – Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the unfolding events of the music itself. This 'embodied meaning' arises from the patterns dopamine in the caudate, as we struggle to anticipate what will happen next. We can predict some of the notes, but we can't predict them all, and that's what keeps us listening, waiting for the pattern to be completed.`,

    title: 'The Power of Smell',
    subtitle: 'Research shows that our olfactory sense is more influential than we realise',
    passage: `Research shows that our olfactory sense is more influential than we realise\n<strong>A</strong> Dog noses are renowned for sensitivity to smells, while human noses are thought to be poor by comparison, yet that might be a misconception. According to recent studies, our noses are in fact acutely sensitive instruments that guide our everyday life to a surprising extent. Subtle smells can change your mood, behaviour and the choices you make, often without you realising it. Our own odours meanwhile, indicate emotional states such as fear or sadness to those around us. The big mystery is why we aren't more aware of our nasal activity. Noses have certainly never been at the forefront of sensory research, and were pushed aside until recently in favour of the seemingly more vital senses of vision and hearing. 'There has been a lot of prejudice that people are not that influenced by olfactory stimuli, especially compared to other mammals,' says Lilianne Mujica-Parodi, who studies the neurobiology of human stress at Stony Brook University in New York, in the United States.\n<strong>B</strong> One of the first people to assert the relative unimportance of human smelling was Pierre Paul Broca, an influential 19th-century anatomist. After comparing the proportion of the brain devoted to smell in different animals, he suggested that mammals can be classed into two broad groups: macrosmatic mammals, such as dogs, have a finely tuned sense of smell which they rely on to perceive the world, while we, along with other primates and the marine mammals, are microsmatic – we have small olfactory organs that we only rely on to a small extent. That idea seemed to fit with more recent studies which found that the majority of mammals have genes coding for about 1000 different types of smell receptor. Most of these genes aren't expressed in humans, giving our noses just 400 different types of receptor.\n<strong>C</strong> Yet these findings may have been misleading. Brain scans now show that more of the brain is devoted to smell processing than Broca's anatomical studies suggested. And although we may have fewer types of receptor than other mammals, Charles Greer at Yale University in the United States has shown that the human nose and brain are unusually well connected, with each group of receptors linking to many more neural regions than is the case in other animals. That should give us a good ability to process incoming scents. Once researchers began looking, they found the nose to be far more sensitive than its reputation suggested. One study, for example, found that we can detect certain chemicals diluted in water to less than one part per billion. That means that a person can detect just a few drops of a strong smell like ethyl mercaptan in an Olympic-sized pool.\n<strong>D</strong> 'We are also exceptionally gifted at telling smells apart, even in the case of two molecules whose only difference is that their structures are mirror images of one another. That is fantastic sensitivity', says George Dodd, a perfumer and researcher at the olfaction group of the University of Warwick, in the United Kingdom. What's more, it's becoming clear that the brain’s olfactory centres are intimately linked to its limbic system, which is involved in emotion, fear and memory. That suggests a link between smell and the way we think.\n<strong>E</strong> The power of smell will be no news to estate agents, who often advocate the smell of baking bread or brewing coffee to promote the sale of a house. But there are more subtle and surprising effects too. When Hendrick Schifferstein and colleagues, from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, pumped the smell of orange, seawater or peppermint into a nightclub, the revellers danced more, rated their night as more enjoyable, and even thought the music was better than when there was no added scent. Meanwhile, Rob Holland, of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, found that the hint of aroma wafting out of a hidden bucket of citrus-scented cleaner was enough to persuade students in a hostel to clean up after themselves.\n<strong>F</strong> Other work has found that scent can influence our cognitive skills. A study by William Overman and colleagues at the University of North Carolina in the United States found that when men were subjected to a novel smell – either good or bad – during a task used to test decision-making skills, they performed significantly worse than normal. The researchers conclude the scent stimulated brain areas connected with emotion, making their decisions emotional rather than rational.\n<strong>G</strong> Smells are especially good memory evokers, but it is actually a myth that odours trigger more detailed memories than other stimuli. 'The memory is not more accurate and you don't remember more details,' says Yaara Yeshurun at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, 'but it is unique in that it is more emotional.' This isn't surprising when you consider that there are certain brain areas dedicated to both emotion and olfaction, such as the amygdala. and there is a strong link between emotion and memory. In 2009, Yeshurun found that the link between a memory and a smell is stronger if the smell is unpleasant rather than pleasant. She also discovered that the very first time we attach a smell to an object, it evokes a much greater response in our brains than for any subsequent encounter with the smell or object, laying down stronger foundations for the memory. That doesn't happen with any other sense. Since those first encounters with a smell would have happened at a young age, this explains why smells often transport us back to our childhood.`,

    title: 'Roller coaster: the great fairground attraction',
    subtitle: 'How they move',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Like a passenger train, a roller coaster consists of a series of connected cars that move on a track. But unlike a passenger train, it has no engine or power source of its own. For most of the ride, it is moved only by the forces of inertia and gravity. The only exertion of energy occurs at the very beginning of the ride when the coaster train is pulled up the lift hill.\n<strong>B</strong> The traditional lifting mechanism is a long length of chain running up the hill under the track. The chain is fastened in a loop, which is wound around a gear at the top of the hill and another one at the bottom of the hill. The gear at the bottom of the hill is turned by a motor. This turns the chain so that it continually moves up the hill like a long conveyor belt. The coaster cars grip onto the chain, which simply pulls them to the top of the hill. At the summit, the train is released and starts its descent.\n<strong>C</strong> The purpose of this initial ascent is to build up a sort of reservoir of potential energy, which simply means that as the coaster gets higher in the air, there is a greater distance gravity can pull it down.\n<strong>D</strong> As the train starts coasting down the hill, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (energy of motion), and the train speeds up. At the bottom of the hill, this has reached its maximum, and this propels the train up the second hill, again building up the potential energy level.\n<strong>E</strong> In this way, the course of the track is constantly converting energy from kinetic to potential and back again. This fluctuation in acceleration is what makes roller coasters so much fun. At its most basic level, this is all a roller coaster is – a machine that uses gravity and inertia to send a train along a winding track.\n<strong>F</strong> Roller coasters have a long, fascinating history. Their direct ancestors were ice slides, popular in Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries. They consisted of a long, steep, wooden slide covered in ice. Riders walked up a ladder or set of stairs to the top of the slide, as high as 21 meters up. At the top, they climbed into sleds made out of wood or blocks of ice and shot down the slope. At the base of the slide, the sleds would crash-land in a sand pile.\n<strong>G</strong> It seems that the idea was then imported into France. For most of the year, the warmer climate would melt the ice, so the French started building waxed slides instead. To help the sleds move down these slides, they added wheels, and in 1817, for the first time, a train was attached to the track. The French continued to expand on this idea, coming up with more complex track layouts, with multiple cars and all sorts of twists and turns.\n<strong>H</strong> The first American roller coaster was built in the mountains of Pennsylvania in the mid-1800s originally to provide an easy way to send coal to the railway 29 km down to mountain. When the track was first built, a crew at the bottom of the mountain would attach the cart to a team of mules after emptying the load, and the mules would drag it back up to the top. They were eventually replaced with steam engines, to make the system more efficient.\n<strong>I</strong> Soon after these improvements were made, the railway company built a new tunnel that brought the freight trains much closer to the coal mine. Now no longer required for its original purpose, the roller coaster was configured as a 'scenic tour'. For one dollar, tourists got a leisurely ride up to the top of the mountain, followed by a wild, bumpy ride straight down. This was soon a resounding success, attracting thousands of tourists every year.\n<strong>J</strong> Scenic rides like this continued to thrive and were joined by wooden roller coasters similar to the ones we know today. These coasters were the main attraction at popular amusement parks throughout the United States, such as the many parks of Coney Island in New York. By the 1920s, roller coasters were in full swing, with some 2,000 rides in operation around the country. Following the Great Depression, a decline in roller coaster production began in the early 1930s but a second roller-coaster boom in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s revitalized the amusement park industry, and introduced a slew of innovative tubular steel coasters.\n<strong>K</strong> This was followed by a decline in interest for the rest of the decade, but since the early 1990s the amusement-park industry has experienced another coaster boom of sorts. New launching techniques and other technological developments have opened up a world of options for designers so in some rides you feel as if you are flying. In the next few years we can expect to see many faster, taller and more twisted rides popping up in amusement parks around the world.`,

    title: 'The Impact of Invasive Species',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Invasive species are among the leading threats to the native wildlife of most countries, with approximately 42 percent of endangered species at risk from them. Invasive species can be any kind of organism—for example, a mammal, amphibian, fish, insect, or plant—that is not native to an ecosystem. Often, they reproduce and spread with great speed. Contrary to popular belief, a plant or animal classified as an invasive species does not necessarily originate in another country. For example, lake trout are native to the Great Lakes of North America but are considered an invasive species in Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming because they compete with native cutthroat trout for habitat.\n<strong>B</strong> When a new species is introduced into an ecosystem, native wildlife may struggle to compete with it for food and other resources. Invasive species can change the food web in an ecosystem by destroying or replacing native food sources while providing little or no food for local wildlife. In extreme cases, the invader may prey on the native species. Above all, invasive species threaten biodiversity in many habitats. For instance, the climbing plant species kudzu (which is native to East Asia) can easily replace a habitat that had a wide range of plants with a monoculture consisting solely of kudzu, as has started to happen in the southeast of the USA.\n<strong>C</strong> The phenomenon is not an exclusively modern one. Humans have always transferred a variety of species from one region to another, but the development of rapid means of transportation has increased the frequency of such introductions. Aquatic organisms can be shipped across the oceans, while insects can easily get into the wooden crates that are transported around the world in this way. In addition, climate change has enabled some invasive plant species to colonize new areas. Other invasive species include pets such as snakes or turtles, which are intentionally set free into the wild.\n<strong>D</strong> Invasive species do not all present the same level of threat to native ecosystems and can be classified into three types. The first of these may be introduced species that can maintain themselves in a limited range of habitats without upsetting the ecological equilibrium of the area. Some scientists have even argued that, in these cases, the introduction enhances the diversity of animal and plant life in that specific area. A second group of invaders presents a greater threat because their spread is at the expense of one native species. The North American grey squirrel, for example, was introduced to the UK in 1876 largely because wealthy landowners thought it would be a fashionable and attractive addition to the local wildlife on their estates. It spread widely, leading directly to the dramatic decline in the population of the native red squirrel. However, it would appear that this is the only definite negative impact of the grey squirrel.\n<strong>E</strong> There is a third level of threat in which the dominance of the introduced species has an extremely destructive effect on the entire ecosystem. One of the most damaging examples involved a species of comb jellyfish. Native to estuaries along the western Atlantic coast from the northern United States to the Valdés Peninsula in Argentina, this species was released from a ship into the Black Sea in Eastern Europe in 1982, almost certainly by accident. The Black Sea has levels of industrial waste that are, by international standards, exceptionally high. Despite this, fishing boats were still able to catch healthy numbers of fish. But when the invading jellyfish underwent a population explosion in the space of just six years, the entire marine ecosystem was transformed, and fish numbers declined dramatically because they were in competition with the jellyfish, preying on exactly the same microscopic creatures. The jellyfish had a more serious impact on the ecosystem than the heavily polluted water.\n<strong>F</strong> More than a century after its introduction outside its native range on the Amazon River in South America, a plant known as a water hyacinth can be found in tropical lakes, streams, and rivers around the world. Its beauty attracted botanists seeking exotic plants for botanical gardens, and they imported it to a horticultural exhibition in New Orleans in 1884. Visitors were so impressed that they planted it in many locations during the 1880s and 1890s, resulting in the aquatic ecosystems of the southeastern United States being progressively colonized by vast, floating, dense carpets of water hyacinth. Today, it is present around the globe, damaging boat engines and even blocking cooling pipes for power plants, occasionally leading to massive blackouts. The impact of the water hyacinth on native water plants is largely unstudied, as is unfortunately the case for most ecosystems invaded by new plant species.\n<strong>G</strong> In the United States, more than 7,000 introduced species have established themselves, of which at least 15 percent cause ecological damage. As the number of invasive species expands, legislation to deal with this problem is rare or non-existent in the majority of countries. Unfortunately, ordinary people outside the scientific community have a very limited understanding of the threat posed by invasive species, which means that other environmental threats receive considerably more media attention. The introduction of new species can initially seem highly desirable, but the full extent of their impact is consistently underestimated.\n<strong>H</strong> Although ultimately, measures need to be taken at an international level, limited action is possible by individuals. One way is for people to plant native plants in their gardens rather than species from abroad. It is also useful to learn to identify invasive species and report any sightings to wildlife organizations. Regularly cleaning clothing, boots, boats, tires, and any other equipment regularly used outdoors can remove insects and plant parts that may introduce invasive species into new locations.`,

    title: 'Orientation of birds',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> For many of us, the way birds are able to orientate is both astounding and difficult to appreciate fully. For instance, the annual migration of the golden plover of the Pacific takes it from Alaska to Hawaii on a flight of well over 3000 kilometres, and if it were to deviate by only one degree, it would miss the island on which it nests.\n<strong>B</strong> The first systematic studies on orientation in birds were made possible by the 'homing instinct' exhibited by so many species. Birds are caught at a time when they show an attachment to their territory, especially during the nesting season. They are taken to some spot, released, and the percentage of returns is recorded. The distance can be varied, and the direction, as well as the method of transporting them, and then the influence of climatic and other factors on their ability to find their way home can be studied. These experiments have shown a wide variation in ability to home, and three types of homing behaviour have been identified.\n<strong>C</strong> In the first type, birds methodically explore the area in which they are released until they pick up some familiar feature, and then they quickly find their way back to the nest. Such birds possess a highly developed visual memory, as experiments with pigeons have shown. Domestic pigeons have been trained to peck at a certain point on an aerial photograph, with a system of rewards, and four years later the birds were still able to respond to this training when placed on the aerial photograph. Birds' eyes have a power of resolution two to three times greater than ours, enabling them to pick up very fine details. If a bird uses only this type of homing behaviour, however, it can only succeed if the point of release is not too far away. If the birds are transported 800 kilometres from their nest, it is only by good fortune that they find their way back as a result of long exploratory flights. Usually, the area known to a bird is its feeding territory. Released within this area, the birds soon make their return; release them outside it and far fewer return. However, if a bird is released for a second time in the same place, its visual memory comes into play, and the bird, no longer requiring tedious exploratory flights, will return much more quickly.\n<strong>D</strong> The second type of homing behaviour is shown by birds that are capable of choosing their flight direction and holding to it for the rest of their journey. How do they decide what direction to take? They appear to choose their normal migration direction even if they are released in a different place from their usual starting point. For example, birds which normally fly to the north-east to reach latitude 45 degrees north are released at that latitude, they will immediately start flying north-east anyway. So if they're released further to the west, they'll maintain the correct direction, but fly west of their destination, and so fail to arrive.\n<strong>E</strong> The third type of homing behaviour shows the highest degree of orientation. Released at one point, the birds immediately take stock of it, compare its position with that of the nest, decide on the direction and fly off. This happens even if the birds are in a country right off their migration routes, where they have never been before. In one example, a laysan albatross returned to its nesting area on Midway Island in the middle of the Pacific, having flown over 5000 kilometres from the west coast of the USA in just over ten days. This is a perfect example of the third type of homing, for the albatross clearly couldn't rely on any landmarks over the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.\n<strong>F</strong> The percentage of successful birds varies greatly, being highest in those species with a strong migratory behaviour. Thus the lesser black-backed gull is more migratory than the herring gull and more often reaches 'home'. Great migrants such as the swift have the highest percentage of returns. In one case, seven out of nine alpine swifts were recaptured at their nests after being displaced some 1400 kilometres; one made the journey in three days.\n<strong>G</strong> What part does heredity play in all this? Two research studies suggest that instinctive, i.e. genetically inherited, behaviour patterns play a part in navigation. The first was carried out by Ernst Schuz and it is highly significant. Schuz caught first year European storks and released them later, after the departure of the adult storks at a time when they normally make their south-west autumn migration to Africa. The recaptures showed that, in spite of the fact that there were no adults to guide them, the birds unanimously headed south-west. This was a most striking finding, for it showed that the birds had an innate and unlearned attraction for the African wintering area that they have occupied for thousands of years.\n<strong>H</strong> The case of starlings is a little different. These birds have a great aptitude for homing, but this behaviour differs in the different age groups. Birds that were shifted to the south-east of their normal migration route split into two lots. The adults, in full possession of their gift for orientation, found their wintering area by modifying their direction by 90 degrees, whereas the juveniles sought their winter quarters to the south-east of their real position.`,

    title: 'The Remarkable Power of Placebos',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> It's one of our most powerful medical treatments, and certainly our most widely effective. In recent years, it's been found to help help or lessen the symptoms associated with clinical depression, irritable bowel syndrome, panic attacks, coughing, and ADHD, among other conditions. This name of this wonderful treatment? It's the 'placebo effect,' the remarkable power of the human brain to unconsciously influence the functioning and perception of the body.\n<strong>B</strong> The term, which is Latin for 'I shall please,' was first used sometime during the 1700s, but the concept itself dates back centuries. Historically, doctors believed that one of their key duties, in addition to curing a patient, was to console him or her, providing a boost to the morale that could help them to get better faster - sometimes in the form of a dummy medicine that had no effect beyond instilling the expectation of improvement in the patient's brain. It's now widely recognized that, while largely ineffective in improving objective symptoms, such as high blood pressure or an infection, for instance, placebos are genuinely effective in treating subjective, self-reported symptoms, including all sorts of pain. Placebos can take all sorts of forms: inert sugar pills, sham surgeries, and saline injections.\n<strong>C</strong> The singular power of expectations has been demonstrated in a variety of studies. In one, for example, patients given a placebo pill that is referred to as a muscle relaxer will experience muscle relaxation, while those given a placebo called a muscle stimulator will experience muscle tension. The flip side of the placebo, the nocebo effect, is just as powerful - negative expectations can cause as much harm as positive ones can do good. In other studies, it's been shown that pills which are red, yellow, or orange in color are more likely to provide a stimulating effect, while blue and green ones are more often perceived as sedating. One study even found that bigger pills are better when it comes to placebo performance.\n<strong>D</strong> The science that underlies all of these studies isn't well understood at this point. Scientists have conducted some imaging research into the brain on placebos, and they've found that ingestion of a placebo billed as a painkiller leads to increased activity in several areas of the cerebral cortex, as compared to an actual painkiller. These areas are involved in so-called 'higher' functions like memory, attention, thought, and consciousness. A pain-killing placebo, it seems, works differently from a painkiller.\n<strong>E</strong> In a recent headache study, conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School, 66 participants who suffer from chronic migraines were given six envelopes, each containing a pill to be taken after their next migraine attack. Two envelopes were labelled 'Maxalt' - the brand name for the widely used migraine drug rizatriptan - in order to generate positive expectations, while two had no label, to produce neutral expectations, and two were labelled 'placebo,' to generate negative expectations. But for each of the three labels, one envelope held a genuine rizatriptan pill, and one contained a placebo. This allowed the researchers to cross-compare the effectiveness of rizatriptan + positive expectations, rizatriptan alone, and rizatriptan + negative expectations, as well as positive, neutral, and negative expectations in isolation.\n<strong>F</strong> When the scientists analyzed the participants' self-reported pain reductions after taking the pills, the power of the placebo was proven yet again. People who'd taken a placebo pill labelled Maxalt got just as much pain relief as those who'd taken a Maxalt pill labelled as a placebo. Additionally, people who took a Maxalt correctly labelled as Maxalt reported about twice as much pain reduction as those who took a Maxalt pill labelled as placebo. In other words, in treating a complex, chronic form of pain like migraine, the effectiveness of pure expectations was roughly equal to the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical itself\n<strong>G</strong> For a doctor, harnessing the placebo's power doesn't mean intentionally mislabelling pills. Instead, a doctor could simply provide a slightly more positive message about a treatment, lending the power of expectations to that of pharmaceuticals. "When doctors set patients' expectations high, Maxalt becomes more effective," lead author of the study Rami Burstein said in a press statement. Of course, this sort of intentional expectation-setting needs to be done carefully. Doctors have an ethical obligation not to mislead patients or withhold important information. But that doesn't mean that making sure to provide subtle positive cues about the effectiveness of a medication especially when those very cues might well make it work more effectively — is a bad idea. As Ted Kaptchuk, one of the study's co-authors, put it, "the placebo effect is an unacknowledged partner for powerful medications."`,

    title: 'Will Eating Less Make You Live Longer?',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Calorie restriction, or 'semi-starvation' as some refer to it, has been proven to extend lifespan in many living organisms from yeast to mice, but the picture for primates, including humans, is not so clear. Research published by a team at the University of Wisconsin in the United States shows that rhesus monkeys also live longer on a calorie-restricted diet. But those findings disagree with research by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Maryland, also in the United States. Rozalyn Anderson, of the Wisconsin team, says the research is not intended as a recommendation of calorie restriction. 'I find the idea monumentally unattractive!' she says. 'We study it because it is so effective at delaying ageing and the onset of age-related disease. It's a way to tease Out What it is that creates increased disease vulnerability as a function of age’\n<strong>B</strong> Both groups started long-term trials on rhesus monkeys in the late 1980s to determine whether calorie restriction would extend the lifespan of primates. In mice many experiments had come to the same finding: feed them a diet with 30% fewer calories and see a lifespan extension of 40%. The monkey trials were set up a similar way: researchers took the calorie content of a standard monkey diet, cut it by 30% (while continuing to supply all essential nutrients) and monitored whether those monkeys lived longer, healthier lives than those on the standard diet.\n<strong>C</strong> In 2009, with the monkeys approaching old age, preliminary findings of the two trials started coming in. For the Wisconsin monkeys, calorie restriction seemed to be working. Compared to well-fed control animals, the lean monkeys were living longer and suffering less from the diseases of ageing: diabetes, heart disease and brain diseases. However, in 2012 the NIA results emerged with a dramatically different conclusion: their monkeys were not living any longer than the controls, although they were healthier.\n<strong>D</strong> The Wisconsin group's latest results confirm that their calorie-restricted monkeys are living longer than the controls. They also offer a possible explanation of why the two groups' findings don't agree and that lies in the treatment of the control group. The Wisconsin study began with monkeys in early adulthood. Initially, all the monkeys were allowed to eat as much as they liked. A few months into the trial, the monkeys were placed into one of two groups: the controls (who continued to be fed as much as they wished) and the calorie-restricted monkeys (who were given an individualised diet of 30% less than they were previously eating).\n<strong>E</strong> The NIA study differed in two ways. First, the control group of monkeys were not allowed to eat as much as they wished. They were given a diet considered to represent a normal calorie count, while the calorie-restricted monkeys were fed 30% less than that. Second, whereas the Wisconsin monkeys were given highly processed food high in sucrose, making it easy to standardise, the NIA diet was based on whole grains, fish oils, and was very low in sugar. These different settings for the normal control diet may provide an explanation of why the two groups showed different results.\n<strong>F</strong> The Wisconsin group may in effect have studied the effects of 'overeating'. Their control animals weighed up to 10% more than average for their age and gender. Compared to them, the calorie-restricted animals not only suffered fewer diseases, they lived longer. Julie Mattison, head of the NIA study observes that an overweight person who goes to a fast food restaurant every day will obviously benefit if their calories are cut back by 30%.\n<strong>G</strong> The NIA study fed their control monkeys what they considered a 'standard' caloric intake and saw that longevity for monkeys that were fed 30% less was the same. But in Anderson's view, the NIA control monkeys were not fed enough; the NIA was calorie restricting both groups of animals. Their older female control monkeys, for example, weighed nearly 20% less than the national average. Indeed Anderson points out that several of the NIA control monkeys have lived past the age of 40, far exceeding the 27-year average lifespan for captive rhesus monkeys. 'That's the maximum lifespan ever detected for the species, so the idea that their intervention is doing nothing is really at odds with the data,' says Anderson.\n<strong>H</strong> However, neither group had the right notion of a standard diet according to Leonie Heilbronn, who researches calorie restriction and healthy ageing at the University of Adelaide in Australia. Heilbronn points out that the NIA controls were a very healthy set of monkeys and leaner than a control monkey should be. On the other hand, she notes, the Wisconsin controls were a little bigger than they had to be. On balance, Heilbronn agrees with the Wisconsin researcher's argument. I think these studies suggest calorie restriction definitely will increase lifespan,' she says.\n<strong>I</strong> Both studies agree that cutting calories is beneficial to health - in both cases the calorie-restricted monkeys had fewer diseases related to ageing. As to the question of whether calorie restriction extends lifespan in primates, Anderson and Mattison are currently working together to compare the two studies' raw data. They plan to co-publish a joint analysis. The current data conflict will ultimately provide deeper insights into ageing, Anderson predicts. 'The fact the two studies were set up differently, asking the same question in different ways - I think we will gain maximally from that.'`,

    title: 'Preserving Antarctic History',
    subtitle: 'Protecting early buildings in Antarctica',
    passage: `Protecting early buildings in Antarctica\n<strong>A</strong> Few people coming up to the most comfortable dwelling place imaginable are likely to picture wooden huts on an island off the coldest continent on Earth. But that’s where the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott described the hut at Cape Evans on Ross Island that he used for his 1910–13 expedition. The hut is nestled below the cliffs on a flat, long stretch of sand. In 2011, a bottle of MacKinlay’s whisky, the only one, was to be seen in front of the newly restored structure and sun reflects off the cliffs of the nearby glacier.\n<strong>B</strong> The New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust (NZAHT) and its accompanying workers recently announced the completion of 10 years of intensive work to save the historic buildings on Ross Island as well as the hut at Cape Evans, the hut at Cape Royds on Discovery Hut from Scott’s 1901–04 expedition at Hut Point, and the hut at Cape Royds, built for Ernest Shackleton’s 1907–09 expedition. When work began, many of the artefacts were temporarily removed while carpenters from the team of conservation workers repaired walls, floors and roof. In Scott’s ‘command hut’ was the table where team member Edward Wilson had once incubated his moulds and parasites. Of particular interest is the small wooden racks of sample tubes, sample jars and Bunsen burners standing on the biologist Edward Nelson, by its shape through a dusty window. This was where the young scientist preserved Antarctic specimens as part of his search for new species and an understanding of the Antarctic food chain.\n<strong>C</strong> The NZAHT executive director Nigel Watson describes the three restored huts as fantastic remnants of humans’ first contact with the continent. The idea for the birth of the conservation project, he says, was the fact that we were in great danger of losing them. ‘When the site work began in 2004, snow and ice were building up around, under and sometimes inside the huts, damaging the structures and threatening their contents. Now we have three buildings that are structurally sound and watertight with a very different feel – they are drier and lighter and the humidity is reduced. It’s a much better environment for the collection.’\n<strong>D</strong> As well as heritage carpenters, the NZAHT team on Ross Island has included experts in textile, paper and metal conservation: in total, 62 experts from 11 countries have visited Antarctica to work on the project, often spending a whole summer on-site, sleeping in tents around 25km back to Scott Base for the occasional shower. The team is now known as ‘the most exciting conservation project in the world,’ says Watson. ‘So it attracted top heritage conservation talent.’ Some of the most exciting discoveries were the intact cases of MacKinlay’s Rare Old Highland Malt Whisky found encased in ice beneath Shackleton’s hut, a paper notebook that belonged to surgeon, zoologist and photographer George Murray Levick found buried in dirt at Cape Evans and a small box of 22 cellulose nitrate negatives waiting to be developed into photographs found in Herbert Ponting’s darkroom. But most of the 18,202 items catalogued and conserved are more mundane: food, tools, clothing and other personal items that the crews found no purpose to take home on the return voyages.\n<strong>E</strong> The NZAHT team’s conservation treatments involved thorough cleaning, followed by meticulous treatment to help slow or, even reverse, the deterioration. Metal items would go through a chemical process, followed by a chemical stabilization treatment, then repackaged and preserved in airtight containers for future conservation. Treatment of paper items often involved washing to remove harmful acids and to repair the fractured parts so that in some cases the paper was even stronger than before.\n<strong>F</strong> As a result of the project, the NZAHT has become the world leader in cold-climate heritage conservation and its members have been interviewed for numerous television documentaries and radio reports. ‘The Ross Island huts are the jewels in the crown,’ says Watson, but there are other historic buildings needing attention. With logistics support from Antarctica New Zealand, programme managers Al Fastier and Lizzie Meek will be part of a small team heading to Cape Adare, an exposed site more than 700km north of Scott Base. The two Cape Adare huts, remnants of an 1898–1900 British expedition, are not only the first buildings on the continent,’ says Watson, but also the only example of humanity’s first buildings on any continent on Earth.\n<strong>G</strong> The three-year restoration effort will involve construction repairs and the removal, conservation and return of about 11,000 objects. Compared with the huts on Ross Island, which are relatively sheltered, Cape Adare is a ‘very remote and challenging place to work in’, says Watson. It’s set among the world’s biggest colony of Adélie penguins on an exposed spit of land, and it is important that they don’t interrupt the functioning of the colony in any way while they are there. Lizzie Meek looks forward to the challenge. But I’m also looking forward to going back to the Ross Island huts and seeing them with fresh eyes. After so many years of working on them, to be able to step inside and look around to see what we have accomplished will be amazing.\n<strong>H</strong> If you can find your way to Antarctica, you’ll need a permit to visit any of these huts, which each are in an Antarctic Specially Protected Area. But there’s an easier way to see them without making the long journey: the trust has partnered with Google to offer Street View walkthroughs of each of the dwellings, available via Google Earth or through the NZAHT’s website.`,

    title: 'From princes to paupers: how Goya\'s portraits tell the story of Spain',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> There are, according to current scholarship, 160 existing portraits by Francisco de Goya - about a third of his painted output. The real number, though, is much greater since there are no pure landscapes in Goya's work, in that everything he ever painted deals with people. In the work of no other great portraitist are a nation's people, history, traumas, folk traditions, and superstitions so comprehensively and relentlessly captured. His subject was a good one since Goya lived in interesting times: his lifetime was a period that saw Spain pass through the effects of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic wars, and the restoration of the monarchy; it was ruled by a succession of authoritarian and liberal governments; and was simultaneously marked by the Enlightenment. Put his work together – the public and private paintings, the personal drawings and sketches, and the unsettling and sinister etching series – and what you have is a portrait in the round of Spain itself.\n<strong>B</strong> His work as a portraitist has its origins in the 45 tapestry cartoons he painted after he moved to Madrid in 1775. Although his designs don't show portraits, they do show types – the majos and majas who gave Madrid its street swagger, peasants and rich men, courting couples, singers, hunters, children, and young men and women playing blind man's buff or tossing a mannequin into the air. The pictures have a light, rococo palette and the faces are individualised without being those of individuals. But in them, Goya practised poses and groupings and a way of handling light on and around figures that was to be invaluable.\n<strong>C</strong> The tapestry designs also show social roles rather than the people inhabiting them, but when it came to painting portraits proper, Goya would turn this on its head. His greatest strength as a portraitist is that regardless of the status of the sitter, be they a king and queen, the Duke of Wellington, or a doctor or writer, it was the person he showed first and their position second. It was this trait, most apparent in his royal portraiture, that has led him to be seen as satirising the Bourbon monarchy rather than as a painter who depicted what he saw without showing obeisance to the usual flattering conventions. In Robert Hughes's phrase, he did not 'pay reflexive homage to authority' but instead walked a fine line between respect and truth.\n<strong>D</strong> Goya's success was rapid; in 1785 he was made deputy director of painting at the Royal Academy (his main message to his students was subversive – 'there are no rules in painting') and in 1786 became pintor de cámara, required to paint 'works required for royal service'. He immediately spent some of his 15,000-reales salary on a two-wheeled gig (one of only three in Madrid) which he promptly crashed on his first outing. His amour propre untouched, he wrote to his childhood friend Martín Zapater: 'I have now established an enviable way of living: I do not wait on anyone in antechambers, and if anyone wants anything from me they must come to me; I have made myself more in demand and unless it is a person of rank or at the request of a friend I would do nothing for anyone...'\n<strong>E</strong> Part of the reason for his success was that, unlike Gainsborough, for example, he did not resent portraiture as an economically necessary chore that ate away at the time he could devote to higher art. Portraiture fascinated him; it was, after all, part of that 'sacred science which requires so much study' and his portraits reveal a fully engaged artist. There is hardly any repetition in his poses (to help, he drew on prints of English portraits as well as classical statuary), he worked hard to give his sitters in repose a sense of latent movement, and he defined them by the careful depiction of the space around them. When it came to clothing he allowed himself extraordinary freedom, the frogging on uniforms or lace on a dress sketched in thick impasto rather than being laboriously defined. From close up such three-dimensional scumblings look out of focus but from a distance, they coalesce into silks, braiding, and gauze. Such varieties of technique within a painting keep the eye entertained and moving.\n<strong>F</strong> 'My work is very simple. My art reveals idealism and truth,' Goya claimed. The truth though is always more apparent than the idealism. In the most important commission of his career, for example, the portrait of Charles IV and the royal family of 1800, he eschewed entirely the grandeur of majesty to portray the assembled Bourbons as they appeared - a motley grouping (a French visitor had likened Charles and his queen Maria Luisa to a butcher and his wife) in fancy clothes. Goya may have been a political liberal but he wouldn't have jeopardised his hard-won new position as first court painter – the first Spaniard since Velázquez to hold the role - in order to score political points at the expense of his patrons. That his sitters didn't regard the portrait as unflattering was evidenced by succeeding royal commissions, not least his 1815 portrait of Ferdinand VII. Ferdinand himself was physically unprepossessing, tyrannical, vicious, and small-minded and that is exactly how Goya shows him. The king, however, looking in Goya's particular mirror, saw no such characteristics staring back at him.\n<strong>G</strong> The private side of Goya's portraiture was a world away from the public. The contrast between the Ferdinand portrait and the remarkable 1820 double portrait showing Goya with Dr Arrieta, represents a moral version of the three ages of man – the 73-year-old painter in the throes of a debilitating illness being tended by his doctor. If Ferdinand represents human malignity and Goya its frailty, then Arrieta stands for man's innate kindness. While not all his portraits are successful (some have a doll-like stiffness), this is what Goya at his best could do: in the guise of representing individuals he showed, without judging, man as a universal being.`,

    title: 'Is Graffiti Art or Crime?',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> The term graffiti derives from the Italian graffito meaning ‘scratching’ and can be defined as uninvited marking or writing scratched or applied to objects, built structures and natural features. It is not a new phenomenon: examples can be found on ancient structures around the world, in some cases predating the Greeks and Romans. In such circumstances it has acquired invaluable historical and archaeological significance, providing a social history of life and events at that time. Graffiti is now a problem that has become pervasive, as a result of the availability of cheap and quick means of mark-making.\n<strong>B</strong> It is usually considered a priority to remove graffiti as quickly as possible after it appears. This is for several reasons. The first is to prevent ‘copy-cat’ emulation which can occur rapidly once a clean surface is defaced. It may also be of a racist or otherwise offensive nature and many companies and councils have a policy of removing this type of graffiti within an hour or two of it being reported. Also, as paints, glues and inks dry out over time they can become increasingly difficult to remove and are usually best dealt with as soon as possible after the incident. Graffiti can also lead to move serious forms of vandalism and, ultimately, the deterioration of an area, contributing to social decline.\n<strong>C</strong> Although graffiti may be regarded as an eyesore, any proposal to remove it from sensitive historic surfaces should be carefully considered: techniques designed for more robust or utilitarian surfaces may result in considerable damage. In the event of graffiti incidents, it is important that the owners of buildings or other structures and their consultants are aware of the approach they should take in dealing with the problem. The police should be informed as there may be other related attacks occurring locally. An incidence pattern can identify possible culprits, as can stylised signatures or nicknames, known as ‘tags’, which may already be familiar to local police. Photographs are useful to record graffiti incident and may assist the police in bringing a prosecution. Such images are also required for insurance claims, and can be helpful to cleaning operatives, allowing them to see the problem area before arriving on site.\n<strong>D</strong> There are a variety of methods that are used to remove graffiti. Broadly these divide between chemical and mechanical systems. Chemical preparations are based on dissolving the media; these solvents can range from water to potentially hazardous chemical ‘cocktails’. Mechanical systems such as wire-brushing and grit-blasting attempt to abrade or chip the media from the surface. Care should be taken to comply with health and safety legislation with regard to the protection of both passers-by and any person carrying out the cleaning. Operatives should follow product guidelines in terms of application and removal, and wear the appropriate protective equipment. Measures must be taken to ensure that run-off, aerial mists, drips and splashes do not threaten unprotected members of the public. When examining a graffiti incident it is important to assess the ability of the substrate to withstand the prescribed treatment. If there is any doubt regarding this, then small trial areas should be undertaken to assess the impact of more extensive treatment.\n<strong>E</strong> A variety of preventive strategies can be adopted to combat a recurring problem of graffiti at a given site. As no two sites are the same, no one set of protection measures will be suitable for all situations. Each site must be looked at individually. Surveillance systems such as closed circuit television may also help. In cities and towns around the country, prominently placed cameras have been shown to reduce anti-social behavior of all types including graffiti. Security patrols will also act as a deterrent to prevent recurring attacks. However, the cost of this may be too high for most situations. Physical barrier such as a wall, railings, doors or gates can be introduced to discourage unauthorized access to a vulnerable site. However, consideration has to be given to the impact measures have on the structure being protected. In the worst cases, they can be almost as damaging to the quality of the environment as the graffiti they prevent. In others, they might simply provide a new surface for graffiti.\n<strong>F</strong> One of the most significant problems associated with graffiti removal is the need to remove it from surfaces that are repeatedly attacked. Under these circumstances the repeated removal of graffiti using even the most gentle methods will ultimately cause damage to the surface material. There may be situations where the preventive strategies mentioned above do not work or are not a viable proposition at a given site. Anti-graffiti coatings are usually applied by brush or spray leaving a thin veneer that essentially serves to isolate the graffiti from the surface.\n<strong>G</strong> Removal of graffiti from a surface that has been treated in this way is much easier, usually using low-pressure water which reduces the possibility of damage. Depending on the type of barrier selected it may be necessary to reapply the coating after each graffiti removal exercise.`,

    title: 'The dingo debate',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> A plane flies a slow pattern over Carlton Hill station, a 3,600 square kilometre ranch in the Kimberley region in northwest Australia. As the plane circles, those aboard drop 1,000 small pieces of meat, one by one, onto the scrubland below, each piece laced with poison; this practice is known as baiting. Besides 50,000 head of cattle, Carlton Hill is home to the dingo, Australia’s largest mammalian predator and the bane of a grazier's (cattle farmer's) life. Stuart McKechnie, manager of Carlton Hill, complains that graziers’ livelihoods are threatened when dingoes prey on cattle. But one man wants the baiting to end, and for dingoes to once again roam Australia’s wide-open spaces. According to Chris Johnson of James Cook University, ‘Australia needs more dingoes to protect our biodiversity.’\n<strong>B</strong> About 4,000 years ago, Asian sailors introduced dingoes to Australia. Throughout the ensuing millennia, these descendants of the wolf spread across the continent and, as the Tasmanian tiger disappeared completely from Australia, dingoes became Australia’s top predators. As agricultural development took place, the European settlers found that they could not safely keep their livestock where dingoes roamed. So began one of the most sustained efforts at pest control in Australia’s history. Over the last 150 years, dingoes have been shot and poisoned, and fences have been used in an attempt to keep them away from livestock. But at the same time, as the European settlers tried to eliminate one native pest from Australia, they introduced more of their own.\n<strong>C</strong> In 1860, the rabbit was unleashed on Australia by a wealthy landowner and by 1980 rabbits had covered most of the mainland. Rabbits provide huge prey base for two other introduced species: the feral (wild) cat and the red fox. The interaction between foxes, cats and rabbits is a huge problem for native mammals. In good years, rabbit numbers increase dramatically, and fox and cat populations grow quickly in response to the abundance of this prey. When bad seasons follow, rabbit numbers are significantly reduced - and the dwindling but still large fox and cat populations are left with little to eat besides native mammals.\n<strong>D</strong> Australian mammals generally reproduce much more slowly than rabbits, cats and foxes - and adaption to prevent overpopulation in the arid environment, where food can be scarce and unreliable - and populations decline because they can’t grow fast enough to replace animals killed by the predators. Johnson says dingoes are the solution to this problem because they keep cat and fox populations under control. Besides regularly eating the smaller predators, dingoes will kill them simply to lessen competition. Dingo packs live in large, stable territories and generally have only one fertile, which limits their rate of increase. In the 4,000 years that dingoes have been Australia, they have contributed to few, if any, extinctions, Johnsons says.\n<strong>E</strong> Reaching out from a desolate spot where three states meet, for 2,500 km in either direction, is the world’s longest fence, two metres high and stretching from the coast in Queensland to the Great Australian Bight in South Australia; it is there to keep dingoes out of southeast, the fence separates the main types of livestock found in Australia. To the northwest of the fence, cattle predominate; to the southwest, sheep fill the landscape. In fact, Australia is a land dominated by these animals - 25 million cattle, 100 million sheep and just over 20 million people.\n<strong>F</strong> While there is no argument that dingoes will prey on sheep if given the chance, they don’t hunt cattle once the calves are much past two or three weeks old, according to McKechnie. And a study in Queensland suggests that dingoes don’t even prey heavily on the newborn calves unless their staple prey disappears due to deteriorating conditions like drought. This study, co-authored by Lee Allen of the Robert Wicks Research Centre in Queensland, suggests that the aggressive baiting programs used against dingoes may actually be counter-productive for graziers. When dingoes are removed from an area by baiting the area is recolonized by younger, more solitary dingoes. These animals aren’t capable of going after the large prey like kangaroos, so they turn to calves. In their study, some of the highest rates of calf predation occurred in areas that had been baited.\n<strong>G</strong> Mark Clifford, general manager of a firm that manages over 200,000 head of cattle, is not convinced by Allen’s assertion. Clifford says, ‘It’s obvious if we drop or loosen control on dingoes, we are going to lose more calves.’ He doesn’t believe that dingoes will go after kangaroos when calves are around. Nor is he persuaded of dingoes’ supposed ecological benefits, saying he is not convinced that they manage to catch cats that often, believing they are more likely to catch small native animals instead.\n<strong>H</strong> McKechnie agrees that dingoes kill the wallabies (small native animals) that compete with his cattle for food, but points out that in parts of Western Australia, there are no foxes, and not very many cats. He doesn’t see how relaxing controls on dingoes in his area will improve the ecological balance. Johnson sees a need for a change in philosophy on the part of graziers. ‘There might be a number of different ways of thinking through dingo management in cattle country,’ he says. ‘At the moment, though, that hasn’t got through to graziers. There’s still just one prescription, and that is to bait as widely as possible.’`,

    title: 'The Evolutionary Mystery: Crocodile Survives',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Even though crocodiles have existed for 200 million years, they’re anything but primitive. As crocodiles’ ancestors, crocodilia came to adapt to an aquatic lifestyle. When most of the other contemporary reptiles went extinct, crocodiles were able to make it because their bodies changed and they adapted better to the climate. They witnessed the rise and fall of the dinosaurs, which once ruled the planet, and even the 65 million years of alleged mammalian dominance didn’t wipe them off. Nowadays, the crocodiles and alligators are not that different from their prehistoric ancestors, which proves that they were (and still are) incredibly adaptive.\n<strong>B</strong> The first crocodile-like ancestors came into existence approximately 230 million years ago, and they had many of the features which make crocodiles natural and perfect stealth hunters: streamlined body, long tail, protective armour and long jaws. They are born with four short, webbed legs, but this does not mean that their capacity to move on the ground shall ever be underestimated. When they move, they are so fast that you won’t even have any chance to try making the same mistake again by getting too close, especially when they’re hunting.\n<strong>C</strong> Like other reptiles, crocodiles are poikilothermal animals (commonly known as coldblooded, whose body temperature changes with that of the surroundings) and consequently, require exposure to sunlight regularly to raise body temperature. When it is too hot, they would rather stay in water or shade. Compared with mammals and birds, crocodiles have a slower metabolism, which makes them less vulnerable to food shortage. In the most extreme case, a crocodile can slow its metabolism down even further, to the point that it would survive without food for a whole year, enabling them to outlive mammals in relatively volatile environments.\n<strong>D</strong> Crocodiles have a highly efficient way to prey catching. The prey rarely realises there might be a crocodile under the water because the crocodile makes a move without any noise or great vibration when spotting its prey. It only keeps its eyes above the water level. As soon as it feels close enough to the victim, it jerks out of the water with its wide open jaws. Crocodiles are successful because they are capable of switching feeding methods. It chases after fish and snatches birds at the water surface, hides in the waterside bushes in anticipation of a gazelle, and when the chance to ambush presents itself, the crocodile dashes forward, knocks the animal out with its powerful tail and then drags the prey into the water to drown.\n<strong>E</strong> In many crocodilian habitats, the hot season brings drought that dries up their hunting grounds, leaving it harder for them to regulate body temperatures. This actually allowed reptiles to rule. For instance, many crocodiles can protect themselves by digging holes and covering themselves in mud, waiting for months without consuming any food or water until the rains finally return. They transform into a quiescent state called aestivation.\n<strong>F</strong> The majority of crocodilian is considered to go into aestivation during the dry season. In a six-year study by Kennett and Christian, the King Crocodiles, a species of Australian freshwater crocodiles, spent nearly four months a year underground without access to water resources. Doubly labelled water was applied to detect field metabolic rates and water flux, and during some years, plasma fluid samples were taken once a month to keep track of the effects of aestivation regarding the accumulation of nitrogenous wastes and electrolyte concentrations.\n<strong>G</strong> The study discovered that the crocodiles’ metabolic engines function slowly, creating waste and exhausting water and fat reserves. Waste is stored in the urine, becoming more and more concentrated. Nevertheless, the concentration of waste products in blood doesn’t fluctuate much, allowing the crocodiles to carry on their normal functions. Besides, even though the crocodiles lost water reserves and body weight when underground, the losses were proportional; upon emerging, the aestivating animals had no dehydration and displayed no other harmful effects such as a slowed-down growth rate. The two researchers reckon that this capacity of crocodiles to get themselves through the harsh times and the long starvation periods is sure to be the answer to the crocodilian line’s survival throughout history.`,

    title: 'A Unique Golden Textile',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `A two-man project to use spider silk is achieved after 4 years\n<strong>A</strong> A rare textile made from the silk of more than a million wild spiders has been on display at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. To produce this golden cloth, 70 people spent four years collecting golden orb spiders from telephone poles in Madagascar, while another dozen workers carefully extracted about 80 feet of silk filament from each of the arachnids. The resulting 11-foot by 4-foot textile is the only large piece of cloth made from natural spider silk existing in the world today.\n<strong>B</strong> Spider silk is very elastic and strong compared with steel or Kevlar, said textile expert Simon Peers, who co-led the project. Kevlar is a lightweight synthetic fabric which is chemically related to nylon. It is very tough and durable and used in bullet-proof vests. Kevlar is also resistant to wear, tear, and heat and has absolutely no melting point. But the tensile strength of spider silk is even greater than Kevlar's aramid filaments, and greater than that of high-grade steel. Most importantly, spider silk is extremely lightweight: a strand of spider silk long enough to circle the Earth would weigh less than 500 grams (18 oz). Spider silk is also especially ductile, able to stretch up to 140 percent of its length without breaking. It can hold its strength below -40°C. This gives it a very high toughness, which equals that of commercial fibers.\n<strong>C</strong> Researchers have long been intrigued by the unique properties of spider silk. Unfortunately, spider silk is extremely hard to mass produce. Unlike silk worms, which are easy to raise in captivity, spiders have a habit of chomping off each other’s heads when housed together. According to Peers, there’s scientific research going on all over the world right now trying to replicate the tensile properties of spider silk & apply it to all sorts of areas in medicine and industry, but no one up until now has succeeded in replicating 100 percent of the properties of natural spider silk.\n<strong>D</strong> Peers came up with the idea of weaving spider silk after learning about the French missionary Jacob Paul Camboue, who worked with spiders in Madagascar during the 1880s and 1890s. Camboue built a small, hand-driven machine to extract silk from up to 24 spiders at once, without harming them. The spiders were temporarily restrained their silk extracted, and then let go, Peers managed to build a replica of this 24-spider silking machine that was used at the turn of the century, said Nicholas Godley, who co-led the project with Peers. As an experiment, the pair collected an initial batch of about 20 spiders. When we stuck them in the machine and started turning it, lo and behold, this beautiful gold-colored silk started coming out, Godley said.\n<strong>E</strong> But to make a textile of any significant size, the silk experts had to drastically scale up their plan. Fourteen thousand spiders yield about an ounce of silk, Godley said, and the textile weighs about 2.6 pounds. The numbers are overwhelming. To get as much silk as they needed, Godley and Peers began hiring dozens of spider handlers to collect wild arachnids and carefully harness them to the silk-extraction machine. We had to find people who were willing to work with spiders, Godley said, because they bite. By the end of the project, Godley and Peers extracted silk from more than 1 million female golden orb spiders, which are abundant throughout Madagascar and known for the rich golden color of their silk, because the spiders only produce silk during the rainy season, workers collected all the spiders between October and June. Then an additional 12 people used hand-powered machines to extract the silk and where it into 96-filament thread. Once the spiders had been silked, they were released back into the wild, where Godley said it takes them about a week to regenerate their silk. We can go back and re-silk the same spiders, he said. It’s like the gift that never stops giving.\n<strong>F</strong> Of course, spending four years to produce a single textile of spider silk isn’t very practical for scientists trying to study the properties of spider silk, or companies that want to manufacture the fabric for the use as a biomedical product, or an alternative to Kevlar armor. Several groups have tried inserting spider genes into bacteria or even cows and goats to produce silk, but so far, the attempts have been only moderately successful. Part of the reason it’s so hard to generate spider silk in the lab is that it starts out as a liquid protein that’s produced by a special gland in the spider’s abdomen. Using their spinneret, spiders apply force to rearrange the protein’s molecular structure and transform it into solid silk. When we talk about a spider spinning silk, we’re talking about how the spider applies forces to produce a transformation from liquid to solid, said spider silk expert Todd Blackledge of the University of Akron, Ohio, US, who was not involved in creating the textile. Scientists simply can’t replicate the efficiency with which a spider produces silk. Every year we’re getting closer and closer to being able to mass-produce it, but we’re not there yet. For now, it seems we’ll have to be content with one incredibly beautiful cloth, graciously provided by more than a million spiders.`,

    title: 'Should space be explored by robots or by humans?',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> The advisability of humans participating directly in space travel continues to cause many debates. There is no doubt that the presence of people on board a space vehicle makes its design much more complex and challenging, and produces a large increase in costs, since safety requirements are greatly increased, and the technology providing necessities for human passengers such as oxygen, food water must be guaranteed. Moreover, the systems required are bulky and costly, and their complexity increases for long-duration missions. Meanwhile, advances in electronics and computer science allow increasingly complex tasks to be entrusted to robots, and unmanned space probes are becoming lighter, smaller and more convenient.\n<strong>B</strong> However, experience has shown that the idea of humans in space is popular with the public. Humans can also be useful; there are many cases when only direct intervention by an astronaut or cosmonaut can correct the malfunction of an automatic device. Astronauts and cosmonauts have proved that they can adapt to conditions of weightlessness and work in space without encountering too many problems, as was seen in the operations to repair and to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. One human characteristic which is particularly precious in space missions, and which so far is lacking in robots, is the ability to perform a great variety of tasks. In addition, robots are not good at reacting to situations they have not been specifically prepared for. This is especially important in the case of deep space missions. While, in the case of the Moon, it is possible for someone on Earth to 'tele-operate' a robotic device such as a probe, as the two-way link time is only a couple of seconds, on Mars the two- way link time is several minutes, so sending instructions from Earth is more difficult.\n<strong>C</strong> Many of the promises of artificial intelligence are still far from being fulfilled. The construction of machines simulating human logical reasoning moves towards ever more distant dates. The more the performance of computers improves, the more we realise how difficult it is to build machines which display logical abilities. In the past it was confidently predicted that we would soon have fully automated factories in which all operations were performed without any human intervention, and forecasts of the complete substitution of workers by robots in many production areas were made. Today, these perspectives are being revised. It seems that all machines, even the smartest ones, must cooperate with humans. Rather than replacing humans, the present need appears to be for an intelligent machine capable of helping a human operator without replacing him or her.The word 'cobot', from 'collaborative robot', has been invented to designate this type.\n<strong>D</strong> A similar trend is also apparent in the field of space exploration. Tasks which were in the past entrusted only to machines are now performed by human beings, sometimes with the aim of using simpler and less costly devices, sometimes to obtain better performance. In many cases, to involve a person in the control loop is a welcome simplification which may lower the cost of a mission without compromising safety. Many operations originally designed to be performed under completely automatic control can be performed more efficiently by astronauts, perhaps helped by their 'cobots'. The human-machine relationship must evolve towards a closer collaboration.\n<strong>E</strong> One way this could happen is by adopting the Mars Outposts approach, proposed by the Planetary Society. This would involve sending a number of robotic research stations to Mars, equipped with permanent communications and navigational systems. They would perform research, and establish the infrastructure needed to prepare future landing sites for the exploration of Mars by humans. It has also been suggested that in the most difficult environments, as on Venus or Jupiter, robots could be controlled by human beings located in spaceships which remain in orbit around the planet. In this case the link time for communication between humans and robots would be far less than it would be from Earth.\n<strong>F</strong> But if space is to be more than a place to build automatic laboratories or set up industrial enterprises in the vicinity of our planet, the presence of humans is essential. They must learn how to voyage through space towards destinations which will be not only scientific bases but also places to live. If space is a frontier, that frontier must see the presence of people. So the aim for humankind in the future will be not just the exploration of space, but its colonisation. The result of exploring and living in space may be a deep change in the views which humankind has of itself. And this process is already under way. The images of Earth taken from the Moon in the Apollo programme have given humankind a new consciousness of its fragility, its smallness, and its unity. These impressions have triggered a realisation of the need to protect and preserve it, for it is the place in the solar system most suitable for US and above all it is the only place we have, at least for now.`,

    title: 'How deserts are formed?',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> A desert refers to a barren section of land, mainly in arid and semi-arid areas, where there is almost no precipitation, and the environment is hostile for any creature to inhabit. Deserts have been classified in a number of ways, generally combining total precipitation, how many days the rainfall occurs, temperature, humidity, and sometimes additional factors. In some places, deserts have clear boundaries marked by rivers, mountains or other landforms, while in other places, there are no clear-cut borders between desert and other landscape features.\n<strong>B</strong> In arid areas where there is not any covering of vegetation protecting the land, sand and dust storms will frequently take place. This phenomenon often occurs along the desert margins instead of within the deserts, where there are already no finer materials left. When a steady wind starts to blow, fine particles on the open ground will begin vibrating. As the wind picks up, some of the particles are lifted into the air. When they fall onto the ground, they hit other particles which will then be jerked into the air in their turn, initiating a chain reaction.\n<strong>C</strong> There has been a tremendous deal of publicity on how severe desertification can be, but the academic circle has never agreed on the causes of desertification. A common misunderstanding is that a shortage of precipitation causes the desertification—even the land in some barren areas will soon recover after the rain falls. In fact, more often than not, human activities are responsible for desertification. It might be true that the explosion in world population, especially in developing countries, is the primary cause of soil degradation and desertification. Since the population has become denser, the cultivation of crops has gone into progressively drier areas. It’s especially possible for these regions to go through periods of severe drought, which explains why crop failures are common. The raising of most crops requires the natural vegetation cover to be removed first; when crop failures occur, extensive tracts of land are devoid of a plant cover and thus susceptible to wind and water erosion. All through the 1990s, dryland areas went through a population growth of 18.5 per cent, mostly in severely impoverished developing countries.\n<strong>D</strong> Livestock farming in semi-arid areas accelerates the erosion of soil and becomes one of the reasons for advancing desertification. In such areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses, the breeding of livestock is a major economic activity. Grasses are necessary for anchoring barren topsoil in a dryland area. When a specific field is used to graze an excessive herd, it will experience a loss in vegetation coverage, and the soil will be trampled as well as be pulverised, leaving the topsoil exposed to destructive erosion elements such as winds and unexpected thunderstorms. For centuries, nomads have grazed their flocks and herds to any place where pasture can be found, and oases have offered chances for a more settled way of living. For some nomads, wherever they move to, the desert follows.\n<strong>E</strong> Trees are of great importance when it comes to maintaining topsoil and slowing down the wind speed. In many Asian countries, firewood is the chief fuel used for cooking and heating, which has caused uncontrolled clear-cutting of forests in dryland ecosystems. When too many trees are cut down, windstorms and dust storms tend to occur.\n<strong>F</strong> What’s worse, even political conflicts and wars can also contribute to desertification. To escape from the invading enemies, the refugees will move altogether into some of the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet. They bring along their cultivation traditions, which might not be the right kind of practice for their new settlement.\n<strong>G</strong> In the 20th century, one of the states of America had a large section of farmland that had turned into desert. Since then, actions have been enforced so that such a phenomenon of desertification will not happen again. To avoid the reoccurring of desertification, people shall find other livelihoods which do not rely on traditional land uses, are not as demanding on local land and natural resource, but can still generate viable income. Such livelihoods include but are not limited to dryland aquaculture for the raising of fish, crustaceans and industrial compounds derived from microalgae, greenhouse agriculture, and activities that are related to tourism. Another way to prevent the reoccurring of desertification is bringing about economic prospects in the city centres of drylands and places outside drylands. Changing the general economic and institutional structures that generate new chances for people to support themselves would alleviate the current pressures accompanying the desertification processes.\n<strong>H</strong> In nowadays society, new technologies are serving as a method to resolve the problems brought by desertification. Satellites have been utilised to investigate the influence that people and livestock have on our planet Earth. Nevertheless, it doesn’t mean that alternative technologies are not needed to help with the problems and process of desertification.`,

    subtitle: 'How an ancient building material is influencing modern construction',
    passage: `How an ancient building material is influencing modern construction\n<strong>A</strong> In a quest to make concrete more durable and sustainable, an international team of geologists and engineers has found inspiration in the concrete used by the ancient Romans. The chemical secrets of Roman concrete have been uncovered in samples taken from a concrete breakwater that has been submerged in seawater. The breakwater has spent the last 2,000 years submerged in seawater. The international team of researchers that collected the samples was led by Paulo Monteiro, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Analysis of samples from the ancient Roman underwater site in Pozzuoli Bay near Naples in Italy, and pinpointed why the best Roman concrete was superior to most modern concrete.\n<strong>B</strong> Concrete was the Roman Empire’s construction material of choice. It was used in land monuments such as the Pantheon in Rome, as well as in underwater and partially underwater coastal and harbor structures. Monteiro and his team were particularly interested in how the coastal and harbor structures endured the unforgiving saltwater environment. Chemical analysis of Roman concrete showed that it differs from the modern kind in several ways. One is the content of recent cement decades has been Portland cement. Portland cement is a compound of calcium, silicate, and hydrates (C-S-H). However, analysis of Roman concrete shows that it contains a significantly different cement. Roman cement contains aluminum, which is not found in Portland cement, and less silicon than is found in Portland cement. The resulting calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate (C-A-S-H) is an exceptionally stable cement.\n<strong>C</strong> The recipe for the contents of Roman concrete was first described around 30 BC by Vitruvius, an engineer for the Roman Emperor Augustus. Volcanic ash was one of the ingredients, and it is now understood that this is crucial, as it is volcanic ash that contains the aluminum that ultimately gives Roman concrete its great durability. The Romans devised an efficient method of making concrete for coastal structures. They combined volcanic ash with lime, which added stones and chunks of rock, into wooden molds, which were then immersed in seawater. The seawater instantly triggered a hot chemical reaction. The lime was hydrated by the seawater, which means that it incorporated water molecules into its structure, and reacted with the volcanic ash to cement the whole mixture together. This reaction formed the concrete that was used to build some of the most enduring structures in Western civilization.\n<strong>D</strong> According to Marie Jackson, a member of the research team, Roman concrete is one of the most durable construction materials on the planet, and that was no accident. Shipping was the lifeline of political, economic, and military stability for the Roman Empire, so constructing harbors was critical. "Over time, the Romans used less and less concrete. 'As the [shipping] would last [military stability], the need for [seawater concrete] declined,' said Jackson. 'And [original structures] were built so well that, once they were in place, they didn't need to be replaced,' she added.\n<strong>E</strong> Producing Roman concrete also left a smaller carbon footprint than its modern counterpart. 'It's not good—it's so good we use 19 billion tons of [concrete] a year,' says Monteiro. The problem is that manufacturing puts Portland cement into the air, seven percent of the carbon dioxide that manufacturing puts into the air. Portland cement holds most modern concrete together. However, making Portland cement releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fuel in order to heat a mix of limestone and clays to 1,450 degrees Celsius. The production of Roman concrete was a third lower than that required for making Portland cement was sufficient for making Roman concrete.\n<strong>F</strong> Some modern concrete no longer contains Portland cement; instead, fly ash is used, which causes fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Fly ash is a waste product from burning coal, and the researchers are investigating whether volcanic ash would be a good, large-volume replacement in countries that cannot access fly ash easily. 'There is not enough fly ash, so the idea is to find alternative local materials that will work, including the kind of volcanic ash that Romans used. Using these alternatives could replace 40 percent of the world's demand for Portland cement,' said Monteiro.\n<strong>G</strong> Cutting greenhouse gas emissions is one powerful incentive for finding a better way to provide the concrete the world needs; another is the need for stronger, longer-lasting buildings, bridges, and structures. In the middle 20th century, we designed bridges to last 50 years and a lot of them are on borrowed time,' Monteiro says. 'Now we design buildings to last 100 to 120 years.' Yet Roman harbor installations have survived 2,000 years of chemical attack from seawater and wave action. Stronger, longer-lasting modern concrete may be the legacy of a deeper understanding of how the Romans made their incomparable concrete.`,
