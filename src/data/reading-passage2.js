    title: "The Rise of Urban Farming",
    subtitle: "How cities are transforming their approach to food production",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> The concept of growing food in urban environments is not new – city dwellers have cultivated vegetables in backyards and on windowsills for generations. However, a significant shift is occurring as urban farming moves from a hobby practiced by enthusiastic amateurs to a commercial enterprise that could help address global food security challenges. Modern urban farms employ sophisticated technologies and innovative techniques that would have seemed like science fiction just a few decades ago.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Vertical farming represents one of the most dramatic innovations in urban agriculture. These facilities stack growing beds in layers, sometimes dozens of stories high, within controlled indoor environments. LED lights provide the precise wavelengths plants need for photosynthesis, while hydroponic or aeroponic systems deliver nutrients directly to roots without soil. The controlled conditions allow year-round production regardless of external weather, and the closed systems use up to 95% less water than traditional agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> The economics of vertical farming have improved substantially. Early ventures struggled with the enormous energy costs required to power lights and climate control systems. However, advances in LED efficiency and renewable energy have changed the calculation. A vertical farm in Singapore now produces vegetables at prices competitive with imported produce, while a facility in New Jersey supplies restaurants throughout New York City with freshly harvested greens delivered within hours of picking.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Rooftop farms represent another approach to urban agriculture. Unlike vertical farms, these operations use natural sunlight, dramatically reducing energy requirements. The Brooklyn Grange in New York City operates the world's largest rooftop soil farms, spanning over two acres across multiple buildings. Beyond producing vegetables, these green roofs provide additional benefits: they reduce building heating and cooling costs, manage stormwater runoff, and create habitat for pollinators in otherwise barren urban landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> Critics argue that urban farming cannot meaningfully contribute to food supply at scale. Traditional rural agriculture benefits from economies of scale that urban operations cannot match. Land in cities is expensive, and the compact nature of urban farms means they cannot compete with vast rural operations in terms of total output. A single large farm in California's Central Valley might produce more lettuce in a year than all urban farms in North America combined.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Proponents counter that urban farms should not be evaluated solely on production volume. These operations excel at growing high-value crops like herbs and specialty greens that command premium prices. They can also produce varieties bred for flavor rather than transportability – crops that would not survive the journey from distant farms to urban supermarkets. Furthermore, the educational value of urban farms in reconnecting city residents with food production has benefits that resist quantification.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> The environmental arguments for urban farming are complex. While local production eliminates transportation emissions and reduces packaging waste, the energy intensity of indoor growing can offset these gains. A comprehensive life-cycle assessment found that greenhouse-grown tomatoes in the UK had a larger carbon footprint than those shipped from Spain, where natural conditions favor production. The calculation varies by crop, location, and the specific technologies employed.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Looking ahead, the integration of urban farming into city planning represents perhaps the most promising development. Singapore has incorporated vertical farming into its national food security strategy, aiming to produce 30% of nutritional needs locally by 2030. Paris has approved plans for the world's largest urban farm on an exhibition center rooftop. As cities grow and agricultural land diminishes, the ability to produce food where people live may shift from an interesting experiment to an essential component of sustainable urban development.</p>`,

    title: "The Science of Sleep",
    subtitle: "Understanding why we sleep and what happens when we don't",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> Sleep has long puzzled scientists. From an evolutionary perspective, the unconscious state seems remarkably dangerous – animals that sleep are vulnerable to predators and cannot forage for food or care for offspring. Yet every animal species studied, from fruit flies to elephants, engages in some form of sleep or sleep-like behavior, suggesting that the benefits must outweigh the considerable risks.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Research has revealed that sleep serves multiple essential functions. During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, transferring information from short-term to long-term storage. Studies show that people who sleep after learning new material remember it better than those who remain awake for the same period. The sleeping brain also appears to solve problems creatively, with many scientific insights and artistic inspirations emerging from dreams or the moments between sleep and waking.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> Perhaps most remarkably, scientists have discovered that the brain has its own waste-removal system that operates primarily during sleep. The glymphatic system, identified only in 2012, pumps cerebrospinal fluid through brain tissue, flushing out toxic proteins that accumulate during waking hours. These proteins include beta-amyloid, associated with Alzheimer's disease, raising the possibility that chronic sleep deprivation may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Sleep architecture varies across the night. The first hours of sleep are dominated by deep slow-wave sleep, during which the brain's electrical activity synchronizes in slow, rhythmic patterns. Growth hormone is released, tissues repair themselves, and the immune system strengthens. Later in the night, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predominates, characterized by vivid dreams, paralyzed muscles, and brain activity patterns resembling wakefulness.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> The consequences of insufficient sleep extend far beyond tiredness. Sleep-deprived individuals show impaired judgment, reduced reaction times, and difficulty regulating emotions. Studies of medical residents working extended shifts found error rates comparable to those with blood alcohol levels exceeding legal driving limits. Chronic sleep restriction has been linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and shortened lifespan.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Modern life poses unprecedented challenges to healthy sleep. Electric lighting extends the day, suppressing the hormone melatonin that signals sleepiness. Screens emit blue light particularly effective at disrupting circadian rhythms. The constant connectivity enabled by smartphones creates pressure to remain available around the clock, while caffeine consumption masks the natural drive to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Individual sleep needs vary considerably. While the average adult requires seven to nine hours nightly, some people function well on six hours, and others need ten. Age significantly affects sleep patterns – teenagers' circadian rhythms shift later, making early school start times particularly challenging, while older adults often experience fragmented sleep and earlier waking times. Genetics also plays a role, with some individuals naturally inclined toward morningness or eveningness.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Improving sleep often requires addressing multiple factors. Sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent sleep and wake times, keeping bedrooms cool and dark, avoiding screens before bed, and limiting caffeine to morning hours. For some individuals, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) proves more effective than sleeping pills, addressing the anxiety and rumination that perpetuate sleep difficulties without the side effects and dependency risks of medication.</p>`,

    title: "Coral Reef Conservation",
    subtitle: "The challenges of protecting marine ecosystems in a changing world",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> Coral reefs, often called the rainforests of the sea, support approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. These remarkable ecosystems provide essential services to human communities: they protect coastlines from storms and erosion, support fisheries that feed millions of people, generate tourism revenue, and serve as sources for pharmaceutical compounds. Yet coral reefs face an unprecedented crisis, with scientists warning that most reefs could disappear within decades without dramatic intervention.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Climate change poses the gravest threat to coral survival. Corals exist in a narrow temperature range, and even small increases in water temperature can trigger coral bleaching. During bleaching events, stressed corals expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients and color, leaving behind white skeletons. While corals can recover from brief bleaching episodes, prolonged or repeated events prove fatal. The 2016-2017 bleaching event killed half the corals on Australia's Great Barrier Reef.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> Ocean acidification compounds the temperature threat. As oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, seawater becomes more acidic. This acidification reduces the availability of calcium carbonate, the building block corals use to construct their skeletons. In increasingly acidic conditions, corals grow more slowly and existing structures become more vulnerable to erosion. Some projections suggest that by mid-century, ocean chemistry may become too hostile for coral reef formation in many areas.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Local stressors add to global pressures. Coastal development destroys reef habitat and increases sediment runoff that smothers corals and blocks light. Agricultural fertilizers fuel algal blooms that compete with corals for space. Overfishing removes herbivorous fish that would otherwise keep algae in check, and destructive fishing practices using explosives or cyanide directly damage reef structures. While these local factors are more immediately controllable than climate change, addressing them requires coordination among diverse stakeholders with competing interests.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> Conservation efforts operate on multiple fronts. Marine protected areas (MPAs) restrict harmful activities in designated zones, allowing damaged reefs to recover. Studies show that well-managed MPAs can increase coral cover and fish populations significantly. However, MPAs alone cannot address threats that originate outside their boundaries, such as warming waters or pollution carried by currents.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Scientists are developing innovative techniques to accelerate reef recovery. Coral gardening involves collecting coral fragments, growing them in nurseries, and transplanting them to degraded reefs. Heat-resistant coral strains, either identified in naturally warm environments or developed through selective breeding, may help reefs withstand future temperature extremes. Some researchers are even exploring the possibility of genetically engineering corals with enhanced tolerance to stress.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> The scale of restoration needed exceeds current capacity by orders of magnitude. The Great Barrier Reef alone spans 344,400 square kilometers – far too large for fragment-by-fragment restoration. Researchers are investigating techniques to scale up interventions, including using robots to plant coral larvae and deploying devices that attract coral spawn to depleted areas. These approaches remain experimental, and none can substitute for addressing the root causes of coral decline.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> The fate of coral reefs ultimately depends on global action to limit climate change. Scientists estimate that even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels – the most ambitious target of the Paris Agreement – 70-90% of existing coral reefs may be lost. Higher warming levels would eliminate virtually all reefs. Saving what remains requires both immediate action to reduce local stressors and transformative changes to energy systems that would halt and eventually reverse the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>`,

    title: "The Psychology of Decision Making",
    subtitle: "Why humans often make irrational choices",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> Classical economics assumed humans were rational actors who carefully weighed costs and benefits before making decisions. This assumption, while mathematically convenient, fails to describe how people actually behave. Decades of research in behavioral economics and psychology have revealed systematic patterns in how human judgment departs from rational ideals – patterns that have profound implications for everything from personal finance to public policy.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> One of the most influential concepts to emerge from this research is loss aversion. Experiments consistently show that people feel the pain of losses more intensely than the pleasure of equivalent gains – roughly twice as intensely, according to most estimates. This asymmetry explains why investors often hold losing stocks too long, hoping to avoid realizing a loss, while selling winning stocks too quickly to lock in gains. It also explains why people frequently reject gambles that would be advantageous on average, such as a 50% chance to win $150 versus a 50% chance to lose $100.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> The way choices are presented, or framed, dramatically affects decisions. A medical treatment described as having a 90% survival rate seems more appealing than one with a 10% mortality rate, despite the identical information. Ground beef labeled as 75% lean sells better than identical beef labeled 25% fat. These framing effects violate the economic assumption that people respond to objective reality rather than its description, yet they appear consistently across cultures and contexts.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Humans also struggle with probability, particularly small probabilities. People systematically overestimate the likelihood of dramatic but rare events like plane crashes or terrorist attacks, while underestimating common risks like car accidents or heart disease. This helps explain why some individuals purchase lottery tickets while remaining uninsured against more probable misfortunes. The availability of vivid examples in memory, often supplied by news media, distorts perceived probability.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> Present bias describes the tendency to overvalue immediate rewards relative to future ones. Most people, when offered a choice between $100 today and $110 in a week, choose the immediate payment – even though the one-week return vastly exceeds any available investment opportunity. This bias contributes to undersaving for retirement, difficulty adhering to diet and exercise plans, and the challenge of addressing long-term problems like climate change that require present sacrifices for future benefits.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Choice overload represents another departure from the rational model. While classical economics suggests that more options always improve outcomes by allowing finer calibration to preferences, experiments reveal that too many choices can paralyze decision-making. In one famous study, supermarket shoppers encountered displays featuring either 6 or 24 varieties of jam. While the larger display attracted more attention, shoppers who saw it were far less likely to actually purchase jam. The effort required to evaluate numerous options can exceed the benefits of having them.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Understanding these patterns has practical applications. Policymakers have learned to design choices that account for human psychology rather than fighting against it. Automatic enrollment in retirement savings plans, with the option to opt out, dramatically increases participation compared to voluntary enrollment, even though the same options exist in both cases. Simplifying paperwork and reducing the number of decisions required has improved take-up of beneficial programs from healthcare to education.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Critics worry that such interventions, sometimes called "nudges," represent paternalistic manipulation. Defenders counter that any choice architecture influences decisions – there is no neutral design – and that thoughtful architecture that helps people achieve their own stated goals differs from manipulation toward ends they would reject. The debate continues, but the underlying research has fundamentally changed our understanding of how humans actually make decisions.</p>`,

    title: "The History of Writing Systems",
    subtitle: "How humans developed the technology of recording language",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> Writing stands among humanity's most transformative inventions. Before writing, knowledge could only be transmitted through speech, limiting information to what individuals could remember and relay in person. Writing externalized memory, allowing complex ideas to be preserved indefinitely and transmitted across vast distances. This seemingly simple technology enabled the accumulation of knowledge across generations that underlies modern civilization.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> The earliest writing systems emerged independently in at least three locations: Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE, Egypt around 3000 BCE, and China around 1200 BCE. Mesoamerican writing may represent a fourth independent invention, though some scholars argue for diffusion from other cultures. In each case, writing arose in complex societies with centralized administration, suggesting that record-keeping needs drove its development.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> Mesopotamian cuneiform illustrates how writing evolved from simpler precursors. For millennia before writing, people used small clay tokens in various shapes to record economic transactions – a sphere might represent a measure of grain, a cone an amount of oil. Eventually, scribes began impressing these tokens into clay tablets, creating marks that represented the tokens. These pictographic marks gradually became more abstract and were used to represent sounds rather than just objects, enabling the recording of language rather than merely quantities.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Writing systems vary fundamentally in what units of language they represent. Logographic systems use symbols for words or morphemes; Chinese writing exemplifies this approach, with thousands of characters representing meaningful units. Syllabic systems use symbols for syllables, as in Japanese hiragana. Alphabetic systems, like the one you are reading now, represent individual sounds with separate characters, theoretically requiring only a small number of symbols to encode any word.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> The alphabet was invented only once in human history. All alphabetic writing systems descend from a single ancestor developed by Semitic peoples in the region of modern Syria and Palestine around 1800 BCE. These inventors borrowed the idea of writing from Egyptian hieroglyphics but radically simplified it, selecting symbols for consonant sounds only. The Greeks later added vowels, creating the complete alphabet that spread throughout the Mediterranean and eventually the world.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> The technology of writing involves not only the symbols themselves but the materials on which they are inscribed. Clay tablets dominated in Mesopotamia, where clay was abundant and papyrus unavailable. Egyptians wrote on papyrus, a paper-like material made from reeds. The Chinese invented paper around 100 CE, a technology that reached Europe only in the 12th century. Each material shaped writing practices – the curved strokes of Chinese calligraphy, for instance, reflect the properties of brush and paper.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> For most of history, literacy remained restricted to small elites. The complexity of some writing systems posed one barrier – mastering thousands of Chinese characters requires years of study. Social restrictions posed another, with writing often reserved for specialized classes of scribes and priests. Mass literacy emerged only with the spread of printing, universal education, and in some cases, script reforms that simplified writing systems.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Digital technology represents the latest revolution in writing. Electronic texts can be searched, copied, and transmitted instantaneously at minimal cost. More fundamentally, computers have transformed writing from a purely human activity to one that machines can perform. Software translates between languages, generates text from prompts, and even composes creative works. Whether these capabilities will prove as transformative as the original invention of writing remains to be seen.</p>`,

As the world seeks to address climate change, the architecture and construction industries face pressure to fundamentally rethink how structures are designed, built, and operated. Sustainable architecture aims to minimize the environmental impact of buildings throughout their lifecycles while creating healthy, productive spaces for occupants.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Passive design strategies reduce energy needs by working with natural forces rather than against them. Building orientation can maximize winter solar gain while minimizing summer heat. Thermal mass – heavy materials like concrete or stone – absorbs heat during warm periods and releases it when temperatures drop, stabilizing interior conditions. Natural ventilation, carefully designed to capture prevailing breezes, can reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling in many climates.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> The materials from which buildings are constructed carry their own environmental burdens. Concrete, the world's most widely used construction material, generates approximately 8% of global carbon emissions, largely from the chemical reactions required to produce cement. Steel production is similarly carbon-intensive. Sustainable architecture increasingly employs alternative materials – timber, bamboo, rammed earth – that can store carbon rather than release it, and recycled or reclaimed materials that avoid the impacts of new production.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> High-performance building envelopes represent another crucial element. Advanced glazing systems admit daylight while blocking heat transfer far more effectively than traditional windows. Superinsulation reduces heat loss through walls and roofs to minimal levels. Air-tight construction, combined with mechanical ventilation systems that recover heat from exhaust air, prevents the drafts that plague older buildings while maintaining fresh air quality.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> Renewable energy systems can transform buildings from energy consumers to energy producers. Rooftop solar panels have become increasingly cost-effective, with some buildings generating more electricity than they consume over the course of a year. Ground-source heat pumps tap the stable temperatures of the earth to provide efficient heating and cooling. Small-scale wind turbines and micro-hydropower systems offer additional options in suitable locations.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Water efficiency has gained attention as freshwater scarcity intensifies in many regions. Low-flow fixtures reduce consumption without noticeably affecting user experience. Greywater systems recycle water from sinks and showers for toilet flushing or irrigation. Rainwater harvesting captures precipitation for non-potable uses. Some innovative buildings treat wastewater on-site using constructed wetlands or living machines that employ plants and microorganisms to purify effluent.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Beyond environmental performance, sustainable buildings aim to support human health and well-being. Abundant daylight, shown by research to improve mood and productivity, requires careful design to achieve without overheating. Materials selections that avoid volatile organic compounds and other harmful emissions maintain indoor air quality. Access to nature, even views of plants from windows, has documented psychological benefits that designers increasingly seek to provide.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> The economics of sustainable building have shifted dramatically. While green buildings once carried significant cost premiums, advances in technology and growing demand have narrowed the gap. Lifecycle cost analysis often reveals that higher upfront investments yield savings through reduced operating costs. Certification systems like LEED and BREEAM have created market recognition for sustainable buildings, with certified properties commanding rental and sale premiums. As energy costs rise and regulations tighten, conventional buildings increasingly risk becoming obsolete.</p>`,

    title: "Animal Migration Patterns",
    subtitle: "Understanding the remarkable journeys animals undertake",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> Each year, billions of animals undertake journeys of remarkable scale and precision. Arctic terns fly from pole to pole and back, covering up to 90,000 kilometers annually. Wildebeest cross the Serengeti in herds of millions, following seasonal rains. Salmon return from ocean feeding grounds to the exact streams where they hatched years earlier. These migrations represent some of nature's most impressive phenomena, the product of evolutionary pressures acting over millions of years.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Migration serves several essential functions. Most fundamentally, it allows animals to exploit resources that are available only seasonally in particular locations. Northern breeding grounds offer long summer days for raising young, while tropical wintering areas provide food when northern regions freeze. Some migrations follow food sources directly – humpback whales travel between nutrient-rich polar feeding waters and warm tropical breeding lagoons. Others track seasonal rainfall patterns that determine vegetation growth.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> Navigation during migration requires sophisticated sensory capabilities that scientists are still working to fully understand. Many birds possess an internal magnetic compass, using magnetite crystals in their beaks or quantum effects in their eyes to detect Earth's magnetic field. The sun's position provides directional information, corrected for time of day using internal clocks. At night, some species navigate by the stars. Salmon appear to follow magnetic maps and chemical gradients in ocean water, eventually recognizing the unique smell of their natal streams.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Young animals often undertake their first migration without guidance from experienced adults. Cuckoos raised by foster parents of different species somehow know to migrate to Africa and return to Europe the following spring. This innate programming must encode both direction and distance of travel, and appears to be updated by natural selection as conditions change. When European blackcaps began spending winters in Britain rather than Spain, adapting to bird-feeder abundance and milder winters, their offspring inherited the novel route.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> Climate change increasingly disrupts migration patterns. Rising temperatures shift the timing of seasonal events – spring arrives earlier, autumn later. Animals that cue migration using day length rather than temperature may find themselves arriving at breeding grounds before food becomes available, or after peak abundance has passed. The mismatch between migrating animals and the resources they depend on threatens populations already stressed by habitat loss and other pressures.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Human infrastructure creates additional hazards. Collisions with buildings kill an estimated one billion birds annually in North America alone. Fences block the movement of large mammals across rangelands. Dams obstruct fish migration, fragmenting populations and preventing access to spawning habitat. Light pollution disorients nocturnal migrants, causing birds to circle illuminated buildings until they drop from exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Conservation efforts increasingly focus on protecting migration corridors – the routes and stopover sites that migrants depend on throughout their journeys. A bird may breed in Canada, winter in Argentina, and rely on wetlands in multiple countries along the way. Protecting breeding habitat alone cannot ensure survival if critical refueling sites disappear. International agreements have emerged to coordinate conservation across the ranges of migratory species.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Tracking technology has revolutionized migration research. Miniaturized GPS transmitters now allow scientists to follow individual animals in real time, revealing patterns invisible to earlier observers. Geolocators weighing less than a gram record light levels that indicate location, enabling tracking of small songbirds across hemispheric journeys. These tools have produced surprising discoveries – routes that cross open oceans, altitude records that rival commercial aircraft – while identifying threats and priority areas for conservation action.</p>`,

    title: "The Economics of Happiness",
    subtitle: "Can money buy well-being?",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> For centuries, philosophers have debated the nature of happiness and the means to achieve it. In recent decades, economists and psychologists have joined this inquiry, developing quantitative measures of well-being and investigating its determinants. Their findings challenge common assumptions about the relationship between wealth and happiness, with implications for how societies should measure progress and set priorities.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Early happiness research established what became known as the Easterlin paradox. At any given moment, wealthier individuals within a country report higher life satisfaction than poorer ones – a relationship that holds across cultures. However, as countries grow wealthier over time, average happiness does not increase correspondingly. Americans in the 2020s are no happier than their grandparents in the 1950s, despite vastly higher incomes. Beyond a certain threshold, more money seems to produce diminishing returns for well-being.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> Several mechanisms may explain this paradox. Adaptation theory suggests that people quickly adjust to changes in circumstances, returning to a baseline happiness level. A salary increase produces temporary elation, but expectations rise accordingly, and the new income soon feels normal. Social comparison theory emphasizes that people evaluate their situation relative to others. When everyone's income rises together, no one feels relatively better off. Material improvements also bring their own frustrations – more possessions mean more to maintain, insure, and eventually replace.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Research has identified factors that contribute to happiness beyond income. Strong relationships consistently emerge as crucial – people with close friendships and satisfying family connections report higher life satisfaction across all income levels. Meaningful work matters independently of the salary it provides; unemployment causes misery beyond its financial impact. Physical and mental health powerfully affect well-being, as does a sense of control over one's life. Living in a society with low corruption, effective institutions, and social trust also contributes to citizen happiness.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> The findings have prompted some economists to question Gross Domestic Product as the primary measure of national progress. GDP captures market transactions but ignores unpaid work, leisure time, environmental quality, and social cohesion. A country might increase GDP by working longer hours while relationships deteriorate and stress-related illness rises. Alternative measures like the Genuine Progress Indicator attempt to account for factors that GDP misses, though defining and measuring these factors presents challenges.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Some governments have begun explicitly prioritizing happiness in policy decisions. Bhutan famously adopted Gross National Happiness as its guiding metric in the 1970s, evaluating policies based on their effects on psychological well-being, cultural vitality, environmental sustainability, and good governance. More recently, the United Kingdom and several other nations have incorporated subjective well-being measures into their national statistics, supplementing economic indicators with surveys of life satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Critics raise several objections to happiness-based policy. Measuring subjective well-being involves significant challenges – self-reported happiness varies with mood, question wording, and cultural norms about appropriate responses. More fundamentally, some argue that governments should not concern themselves with citizens' psychological states. Providing freedom and opportunity should suffice; whether people choose to pursue happiness or other goals is properly their own affair.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> The research nonetheless offers valuable insights for individual choices. Spending money on experiences rather than possessions tends to produce more lasting satisfaction. Investing in time with loved ones pays dividends in well-being. Comparing oneself to those with less rather than more fosters contentment. While no formula guarantees happiness, understanding its determinants can help people make choices more likely to enhance their life satisfaction.</p>`,

    title: "The Development of Antibiotics",
    subtitle: "A medical revolution and its challenges",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> The discovery of antibiotics stands among the most significant advances in medical history. Before these drugs became available, minor wounds could prove fatal if they became infected, and common illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis killed millions annually. The introduction of penicillin and subsequent antibiotics transformed medicine, enabling surgeries, transplants, and cancer treatments that would otherwise be too risky, and extending average life expectancy by decades.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928 is one of science's most famous accidents. Returning from vacation, Fleming noticed that mold contamination had killed bacteria in a culture dish he had left uncovered. Rather than discarding the dish, he investigated further, eventually isolating the substance responsible – penicillin. However, Fleming lacked the resources to develop his discovery into a usable drug. That task fell to Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, who in 1940 demonstrated penicillin's effectiveness in treating infections and developed methods for its mass production.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> The success of penicillin sparked intensive searches for additional antibiotics. Soil bacteria proved particularly productive sources, yielding streptomycin (the first treatment for tuberculosis), tetracycline, and many others. The period from 1950 to 1970 is sometimes called the golden age of antibiotic discovery, during which most major classes of these drugs were identified. Pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in this research, confident that new antibiotics would continue to emerge as needed.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Antibiotic resistance was recognized as a potential problem from the beginning. Fleming himself warned in his 1945 Nobel lecture that improper use could lead bacteria to develop resistance. The mechanism is straightforward: antibiotics kill susceptible bacteria but leave resistant variants to multiply. Through overuse in human medicine, routine administration to healthy farm animals, and inadequate infection control, humanity has accelerated bacterial evolution toward resistance on a massive scale.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> The resistance crisis has intensified while the discovery pipeline has dried up. Few major pharmaceutical companies maintain active antibiotic research programs. The economics are unfavorable – antibiotics are used briefly and should be reserved for serious infections, limiting the market compared to drugs for chronic conditions. The technical challenges have also grown; the easily discovered antibiotics have been found, and finding new ones requires increasingly sophisticated and expensive research.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Some bacteria have developed resistance to virtually all available antibiotics, raising the specter of a post-antibiotic era in which common infections once again become deadly. Drug-resistant tuberculosis already kills hundreds of thousands annually. Hospital-acquired infections with resistant organisms extend hospital stays, increase healthcare costs, and cause tens of thousands of deaths in developed countries alone. Routine procedures like joint replacements could become too dangerous to perform.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Addressing the crisis requires action on multiple fronts. Antibiotic stewardship programs in hospitals and clinics aim to ensure appropriate use, avoiding unnecessary prescriptions and selecting the narrowest-spectrum drug effective against an infection. Regulations to restrict agricultural antibiotic use have been implemented in some countries. Infection prevention through improved hygiene, vaccination, and diagnostic testing can reduce the need for antibiotics in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Innovative approaches to incentivizing antibiotic development are also being explored. Subscription models would pay companies fixed amounts for providing access to new antibiotics, decoupling revenue from volume sold and encouraging appropriate use. Prize funds could reward successful development of drugs targeting priority pathogens. Public funding for basic research has increased, as has collaboration between academic institutions and smaller biotechnology companies that may be more willing to pursue antibiotics than pharmaceutical giants are.</p>`,

    title: "Language and Thought",
    subtitle: "Does the language we speak shape how we think?",
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> The relationship between language and thought has fascinated scholars for centuries. Does the language we speak merely express our thoughts, or does it actively shape them? The most famous formulation of the latter view, known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis after linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, proposed that linguistic categories determine cognitive categories – that speakers of different languages literally perceive and think about the world differently.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Strong versions of linguistic determinism have largely been abandoned. Claims that the Hopi language, lacking tenses, caused its speakers to have no concept of time proved unfounded upon closer examination. Similarly, the notion that languages with fewer color terms prevent their speakers from distinguishing colors has been refuted by perception studies. Clearly, humans can think about things for which their language lacks words, and speakers of all languages share fundamental cognitive capacities.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> However, weaker versions of linguistic relativity continue to find support in careful research. Languages differ in which distinctions they require speakers to make. English speakers must indicate whether an action occurred in past or present; Mandarin speakers can leave tense unmarked. Spanish speakers must specify whether an object is male or female through grammatical gender; English speakers need not. These obligatory distinctions may not prevent other conceptualizations but could make certain thoughts more habitual or accessible.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Spatial language provides compelling evidence for subtle linguistic effects on thought. Some languages describe spatial relations using relative terms like "left" and "right," which depend on the speaker's perspective. Others use absolute terms like "north" and "south," regardless of orientation. Speakers of absolute-direction languages demonstrate superior orientation abilities, maintaining awareness of cardinal directions even in unfamiliar environments or enclosed spaces – a skill apparently developed through constant linguistic practice.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> Color perception offers another illuminating domain. While all humans can distinguish a similar range of colors, languages carve the color spectrum differently. Russian has separate basic terms for light blue and dark blue, which English lumps together as "blue." Experiments show Russian speakers are faster at distinguishing light and dark blue shades than English speakers, but only when they can use verbal labels – suggesting that language affects categorical perception without altering fundamental color vision.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Grammatical gender has unexpectedly pervasive effects. When asked to personify objects, speakers tend to match their attributions to grammatical gender – describing a grammatically feminine bridge as elegant and a grammatically masculine one as sturdy, for instance. These associations persist even when speakers use a language without grammatical gender, indicating that the native language leaves lasting cognitive imprints. Such effects appear trivial but may shape broader patterns of association and metaphor.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Number words influence mathematical cognition in documented ways. Children learning languages with regular, transparent number systems (like Chinese, where eleven is expressed as "ten-one") master counting and arithmetic faster than those learning irregular systems (like English, with its opaque "eleven"). The cognitive burden of memorizing arbitrary names for numbers delays the development of number concepts, though the ultimate mathematical abilities of adults appear similar across language groups.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> The practical implications of language effects remain debated. Some researchers argue that linguistic diversity represents a cognitive resource, offering different tools for thinking about common human challenges. Others suggest that language effects are too small and too easily overcome by deliberate effort to matter much in practice. What seems clear is that language is neither a neutral medium for expressing pre-formed thoughts nor a prison that determines what can be thought, but something more subtle – a cultural tool that guides attention and shapes the habits of mind through which we engage the world.</p>`,

    title: 'A study of western celebrity',
    subtitle: 'How fame has evolved from ancient rulers to modern media personalities',
    passage: `In our celebrity-obsessed culture, TV shows, internet blogs, and even newspapers are often full of the latest news, gossip and scandals about current celebrities\n<strong>A</strong> It seems that our current society cannot get enough information about the daily lives of celebrities. But how did celebrities become so much an important force in our culture? While people have always had shared a certain obsession for the fantastic and the famous, the notion of celebrity, as well as the types of people termed 'celebrities', has evolved greatly throughout the ages. The word 'celebrity' has its roots in the language of the ancient Roman civilization. The word we now know to mean 'a condition of being famous' or 'a famous person' is derived from the Latin word 'celeber', meaning 'frequented or populous'.\n<strong>B</strong> The celebrities of the ancient world were the powerful and awesome deities of Greece and Rome, and the citizens of these civilizations believed in a vast number of immortals who had a direct impact on their lives. It was, therefore, important to know about these figures' personal lives. This need to know led to the creation of myths, which personalized the gods and involved them in ancient celebrity scandals that thrilled and excited the common people.\n<strong>C</strong> During ancient times, amateur and professional athletes also began to make an impact on the celebrity culture. Victors in the ancient Olympic Games were treated as heroes and were often elevated to god-like status. In the ancient Roman civilization, gladiators — the equivalent of today's professional athletes — were also revered by the common people for their heroics and seemingly superhuman strength.\n<strong>D</strong> As Europe moved into the Dark Ages (the years spanning approximately 400—1300 AD) and a time when athletics and the arts were largely forgotten, monarchs and rulers continued to maintain celebrity status, while religious figures took on newfound fame. The miraculous lives and fascinating deaths of spiritual figures lent excitement to the lives of common people when there was often little else to be excited about, as they faced war, disease and food shortages.\n<strong>E</strong> During the period 1300—1600 AD, or the Renaissance period as it is known, interest in ruling figures faded. As Europe emerged from its long neglect of the arts, there was greater appreciation for portraits, statues and stone carvings. This period of appreciation for the arts lent a sense of celebrity to artists who were noted for their works and their personal achievements. It was a time when artists began to surpass political and religious individuals for supreme celebrity — a trend that would continue into later centuries.\n<strong>F</strong> While the figures of the ancient and early modern civilizations were able to achieve moderate and sometimes lasting celebrity within particular cultures, the global reach of their fame was limited. It was not until the 1700s, when technological advances made publishing commercially viable, that the extent of a person's fame could spread further. The increase in the availability of the written word was accompanied by a huge rise in the number of common people who could read, allowing a mass audience to find out about celebrities for the first time. Suddenly, the lives of authors, politicians, war heroes, and other celebrities could now be read about in newspapers around the world. These gave ordinary people the opportunity to become intimately knowledgeable about the figures they most admired.\n<strong>G</strong> In the modern are, particularly as radio and film took off in the 1900s, things really began to change. First, radio began to make its way into the average home in the 1920s and 1930s. Professional athletes also began to be regarded as stars, as their games and exploits could be broadcast over the air for an entirely new audience. Then, the rise of television in the 1950s only cemented the premier level of celebrity that film stars, athletes and television actors were beginning to share. This also meant a huge increase in the individual salaries of these celebrities. Even a few animals gained fame through children's TV shows. The emergence of reality television shows in the late 1990s allowed all kinds of people with little ability to enjoy a short burst of fame on the television screen. All you needed, it seemed, was an attractive appearance. Today, reality television programmers make it possible to be famous nor for doing anything in particular, but simply for being, with the audience deciding whether someone deserves to become a celebrity or not. As the meaning of celebrity continues to evolve and redefine itself in a quickly changing world, there is no telling who will become of interest next.`,

    title: 'Ideal Homes',
    subtitle: 'What architects and researchers have learned about designing ideal living spaces',
    passage: `New ideas and some old ones\n<strong>A</strong> The traditional kampung houses of Malaysia do not need air-conditioning. Built on stilts and with steep roofs, they have year-round ventilation. The raised structure ensures a cooling breeze comes up through the floorboards, while the high roof acts as a chimney to release hot air. The airtight, concrete boxes of modern city construction, in contrast, are heat traps, says Muhammad Peter Davis of University Putra Malaysia. He has calculated that typical modern Malaysian houses are 5°C hotter than the air outside. The builders of kampung houses "had no knowledge of modern science or engineering but they came up with the perfect design," says Davis.\n<strong>B</strong> This story of ancient architectural sophistication and modern insanity is repeated around the world. In the name of modernism, people have thrown away architecture designed to cope with the environment in which they live, and adopted house designs originating from cold, northern environments, where the idea is to keep heat in.\n<strong>C</strong> Once, the aim of architectural modernists was to build structures that kept nature out and to replace it with air-conditioning. Now they are learning that they cannot do that effectively. Slowly, they are seeing the benefit of working with nature, rather than against it. In California, they probably use more power for air-conditioning than anywhere else on Earth. According to Arthur Rosenfeld from the University of California, what California needs is white paint. If Los Angeles painted its roofs white, planted trees to shade buildings, and chose lighter-colored paving, it could reduce city temperatures by 3°C and cut the annual air-conditioning bill by US$ 170 million a year.\n<strong>D</strong> Modern buildings are greedy in their use of energy. Much is made of the contribution of transportation to global warming, through its emissions of greenhouse gases. But, globally, transportation is responsible for just 22 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. The building sector is responsible for 31 per cent, mostly the result of heating and air-conditioning systems. In developing countries, where demand for electricity for buildings is rising by 5 per cent a year, the biggest demand is for air-conditioning in modern buildings which are often designed to cope with every different climatic condition.\n<strong>E</strong> Before air-conditioning, much of the Arab world kept cool through thoughtful building design. Many buildings were built according to the principles of the wind tower, a tall structure with vertical vents at the top that open in all directions to catch any passing breeze. Typically, these wind-tower buildings were made of local materials such as stone, mud brick, wood and palm-tree fronds. The buildings were inward-looking, which served the dual function of focusing attention on the courtyard, where family members spend time together, and protecting living areas from the rays of the sun.\n<strong>F</strong> Throughout the Middle East today, wind towers are often little more than museum pieces. But there are exceptions. Jordan has won awards for the architecture of a village on the shores of the Red Sea, which is designed to conserve energy. Made of rough, local stone in a traditional style, it combines the ventilation system of the wind towers for summer coolness with up-to-date heating and floor insulation to protect against the desert cold in winter.\n<strong>G</strong> Traditional building materials, like traditional building designs, are being rediscovered by those looking for low-energy solutions to the current construction needs. Clay is one such material: As the Dutch housing contractor R van der Ley has argued in promoting a series of clay housing projects in developing countries, clay has many benefits over its industrialized version, brick. Clay blocks cost only half as much as ordinary bricks. Clay also generates work because people can find it, mould it, bake it and work it themselves. Two hundred clay bricks can be made with the fuel oil that makes just one ordinary brick. Moreover, clay is an excellent insulator against both cold and heat outside, and can easily be recycled.\n<strong>H</strong> But although traditional methods and materials can be revived in appropriate settings, new green, low-energy technologies are needed, especially in urban environments. The thermal insulation of homes in cold countries is an example. In 1983, Sweden adopted a national standard, requiring the country’s homes to lose no more than 60 kilowatt-hours per square metre over the year. To meet that standard, windows were double-glazed, and walls and roofs insulated. Every home became a fortress against the cold air outside. Unfortunately, the rest of Europe has not followed the lead.\n<strong>I</strong> In the United States, Amory Lovins has promoted a range of low-energy technologies: 'super-windows', for example, which let in invisible light but can be ‘tuned’ to either allow in, or reflect away, infrared solar radiation - the stuff that heats. Buildings with large expanses of window (and big energy bills) can be designed to achieve optimum temperatures.\n<strong>J</strong> As well as more efficient use of energy, the world also needs new sources of renewable power. Solar energy is being tried out in the developing world, in villages often far from electricity grids. The world's biggest solar power installation got underway in the Philippines, in 2001, where a project commenced to install solar panels for 400,000 people in 150 villages. Such projects are demonstrating that countries, whether developing or developed, no longer need huge national grids to supply electricity. Every home can do its own thing with the help of a solar panel and a storage battery.\n<strong>K</strong> Houses, of course, are more than machines for living in. They are social and psychological spaces, too. Future houses may not look exactly like kampungs or wind towers or any other traditional models. But to work for us and for our environment, they will have to suit us as well as these traditional forms did.`,

    title: 'Are Artists Liars?',
    subtitle: 'Exploring the fine line between fiction, confabulation, and deliberate deception',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Shortly before his death, Marlon Brando was working on a series of instructional videos about acting, to he called "Lying for a Iiving”. On the surviving footage, Brando can he seen dispensing gnomic advice on his craft to a group of enthusiastic, if somewhat bemused, Hollywood stars, including Leonardo Di Caprio and Sean Penn. Brando also recruited random people from the Los Angeles street and persuaded them to improvise (the footage is said to include a memorable scene featuring two dwarves and a giant Samoan). "If you can lie, you can act." Brando told Jod Kaftan, a writer for Rolling Stone and one of the few people to have viewed the footage. “Are you good at lying?” asked Kaftan. "Jesus." said Brando, “I'm fabulous at it".\n<strong>B</strong> Brando was not the first person to note that the line between an artist and a liar is a line one. If art is a kind of lying, then lying is a form of art, albeit of a lower order-as Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain have observed. Indeed, lying and artistic storytelling spring from a common neurological root-one that is exposed in the cases of psychiatric patients who suffer from a particular kind of impairment. Both liars and artists refuse to accept the tyranny of reality. Both carefully craft stories that are worthy of belief - a skill requiring intellectual sophistication, emotional sensitivity and physical self-control (liars are writers and performers of their own work). Such parallels are hardly coincidental, as I discovered while researching my book on lying.\n<strong>C</strong> A case study published in 1985 by Antonio Damasio, a neurologist, tells the story of a middle-aged woman with brain damage caused by a series of strokes. She retained cognitive abilities, including coherent speech, but what she actually said was rather unpredictable. Checking her knowledge of contemporary events, Damasio asked her about the Falklands War. In the language of psychiatry, this woman was “confabulating”. Chronic confabulation is a rare type of memory problem that affects a small proportion of brain damaged people. In the literature it is defined as "the production of fabricated, distorted or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive”. Whereas amnesiacs make errors of omission, there are gaps in their recollections they find impossible to fill - confabulators make errors of commission: they make tilings up. Rather than forgetting, they are inventing. Confabulating patients are nearly always oblivious to their own condition, and will earnestly give absurdly implausible explanations of why they're in hospital, or talking to a doctor. One patient, asked about his surgical sear, explained that during the Second World War he surprised a teenage girl who shot him three times in the head, killing him, only for surgery to bring him back to life. The same patient, when asked about his family, described how at various times they had died in his arms, or had been killed before his eyes. Others tell yet more fantastical tales, about trips to the moon, fighting alongside Alexander in India or seeing Jesus on the Cross. Confabulators aren’t out to deceive. They engage in what Morris Moseovitch, a neuropsychologist, calls “honest lying". Uncertain and obscurely distressed by their uncertainty, they are seized by a “compulsion to narrate": a deep-seated need to shape, order and explain what they do not understand. Chronic confabulators are often highly inventive at the verbal level, jamming together words in nonsensical but suggestive ways: one patient, when asked what happened to Queen Marie Antoinette of France, answered that she had been “suicided" by her family. In a sense, these patients are like novelists, as described by Henry James: people on whom "nothing is wasted". Unlike writers, however, they have little or no control over their own material.\n<strong>D</strong> The wider significance of this condition is what it tells us about ourselves. Evidently, there is a gushing river of verbal creativity in the normal human mind, from which both artistic invention and lying are drawn. We are born storytellers, spinning, narrative out of our experience and imagination, straining against the leash that keeps us tethered to reality. This is a wonderful thing; it is what gives us out ability to conceive of alternative futures and different worlds. And it helps us to understand our own lives through the entertaining stories of others. But it can lead us into trouble, particularly when we try to persuade others that our inventions are real. Most of the time, as our stories bubble up to consciousness, we exercise our cerebral censors, controlling which stories we tell, and to whom. Yet people lie for all sorts of reasons, including the fact that confabulating can be dangerously fun.\n<strong>E</strong> During a now-famous libel case in 1996, Jonathan Aitken, a former cabinet minister, recounted a tale to illustrate the horrors he endured after a national newspaper tainted his name. The case, which stretched on for more than two years, involved a series of claims made by the Guardian about Aitken's relationships with Saudi arms dealers, including meetings he allegedly held with them on a trip to Paris while he was a government minister. Whitt amazed many in hindsight was the sheer superfluity of the lies Aitken told during his testimony. Aitken’s case collapsed in June 1997, when the defence finally found indisputable evidence about his Paris trip. Until then, Aitken's charm, fluency and flair for theatrical displays of sincerity looked as if they might bring him victory, they revealed that not only was Aitken’s daughter not with him that day (when he was indeed doorstepped), but also that the minister had simply got into his car and drove off, with no vehicle in pursuit.\n<strong>F</strong> Of course, unlike Aitken, actors, playwrights and novelists are not literally attempting to deceive us, because the rules are laid out in advance: come to the theatre, or open this book, and we'll lie to you. Perhaps this is why we fell it necessary to invent art in the first place: as a safe space into which our lies can be corralled, and channeled into something socially useful. Given the universal compulsion to tell stories, art is the best way to refine and enjoy the particularly outlandish or insight till ones. But that is not the whole story. The key way in which artistic “lies" differ from normal lies, and from the "honest lying” of chronic confabulators, is that they have a meaning and resonance beyond their creator. The liar lies on behalf of himself; the artist tell lies on behalf of everyone. If writers have a compulsion to narrate, they compel themselves to find insights about the human condition. Mario Vargas Llosa has written that novels “express a curious truth that can only he expressed in a furtive and veiled fashion, masquerading as what it is not.” Art is a lie whose secret ingredient is truth.`,

    title: 'Bird Migration',
    subtitle: 'How birds navigate incredible journeys across the globe',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Birds have many unique design features that enable them to perform such amazing feats of endurance. They are equipped with lightweight, hollow bones, intricately designed feathers providing both lift and thrust for rapid flight, navigation systems superior to any that man has developed, and an ingenious heat conserving design that, among other things, concentrates all blood circulation beneath layers of warm, waterproof plumage, leaving them fit to face life in the harshest of climates. Their respiratory systems have to perform efficiently during sustained flights at altitude, so they have a system of extracting oxygen from their lungs that far exceeds that of any other animal. During the later stages of the summer breeding season, when food is plentiful, their bodies are able to accumulate considerable layers of fat, in order to provide sufficient energy for their long migratory flights.\n<strong>B</strong> The fundamental reason that birds migrate is to find adequate food during the winter months when it is in short supply. This particularly applies to birds that breed in the temperate and Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where food is abundant during the short growing season. Many species can tolerate cold temperatures if food is plentiful, but when food is not available they must migrate. However, intriguing questions remain.\n<strong>C</strong> One puzzling fact is that many birds journey much further than would be necessary just to find food and good weather. Nobody knows, for instance, why British swallows, which could presumably survive equally well if they spent the winter in equatorial Africa, instead of several thousands of miles further to their preferred winter home in South Africa Cape Province. Another mystery involves the huge migrations performed by arctic terns and mudflat-feeding shorebirds that breed close to Polar Regions. In general, the further north a migrant species breeds, the further south it spends the winter. For arctic terns, this necessitates an annual round trip of 25,000 miles. Yet, en route to their final destination in far-flung southern latitudes, all these individuals overfly other areas of seemingly suitable habitat spanning two hemispheres. While we may not fully understand birds’ reasons for going to particular places, we can marvel at their feats.\n<strong>D</strong> One of the greatest mysteries is how young birds know how to find the traditional wintering areas without parental guidance. Very few adults migrate with juveniles in tow, and youngsters may even have little or no inkling of their parents’ appearance. A familiar example is that of the cuckoo, which lays its eggs in another species’ nest and never encounters its young again. It is mind-boggling to consider that, once raised by its host species, the young cuckoo makes its own way to ancestral wintering grounds in the tropics before returning single-handedly to northern Europe the next season to seek out a mate among its own kind. The obvious implication is that it inherits from its parents an inbuilt route map and direction-finding capability, as well as a mental image of what another cuckoo looks like. Yet nobody has the slightest idea as to how this is possible.\n<strong>E</strong> Mounting evidence has confirmed that birds use the positions of the sun and stars to obtain compass directions. They seem also to be able to detect the earth’s magnetic field, probably due to having minute crystals of magnetite in the region of their brains. However, true navigation also requires an awareness of position and time, especially when lost. Experiments have shown that after being taken thousands of miles over an unfamiliar landmass, birds are still capable of returning rapidly to nest sites. Such phenomenal powers are the product of computing several sophisticated cues, including an inborn map of the night sky and the pull of the earth’s magnetic field. How the birds use their ‘instruments’ remains unknown, but one thing is clear: they see the world with a superior sensory perception to ours. Most small birds migrate at night and take their direction from the position of the setting sun. however, as well as seeing the sun go down, they also seem to see the plane of polarized light caused by it, which calibrates their compass. Traveling at night provides other benefits. Daytime predators are avoided and the danger of dehydration due to flying for long periods in warm, sunlit skies is reduced. Furthermore, at night the air is generally cool and less turbulent and so conducive to sustained, stable flight.\n<strong>F</strong> Nevertheless, all journeys involve considerable risk, and part of the skill in arriving safely is setting off at the right time. This means accurate weather forecasting, and utilizing favorable winds. Birds are adept at both, and, in laboratory tests, some have been shown to detect the minute difference in barometric pressure between the floor and ceiling of a room. Often birds react to weather changes before there is any visible sign of them. Lapwings, which feed on grassland, flee west from the Netherlands to the British Isles, France and Spain at the onset of a cold snap. When the ground surface freezes the birds could starve. Yet they return to Holland ahead of a thaw, their arrival linked to a pressure change presaging an improvement in the weather.\n<strong>G</strong> In one instance a Welsh Manx shearwater carried to America and released was back in its burrow on Skokholm Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, one day before a letter announcing its release! Conversely, each autumn a small number of North American birds are blown across the Atlantic by fast-moving westerly tail winds. Not only do they arrive safely in Europe, but, based on ringing evidence, some make it back to North America the following spring, after probably spending the winter European migrants in sunny African climes.`,

    title: 'Why we love music',
    subtitle: 'The science behind why music moves us and how our brains respond to it',
    passage: `Why does music make us feel? On the one hand, music is a purely abstract art form, devoid of language or explicit ideas. And yet, while listening to our favourite songs, our body betrays all the symptoms of emotional arousal. The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood pressure rise, the electrical conductivity of our skin is lowered, and the brain region associated with bodily movement becomes strangely active. Blood circulates to the muscles in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological roots.\nA recent paper in <em>Nature Neuroscience</em> by a research team in Montreal, Canada, marks an important step in revealing the precise underpinnings of the technology in pleasurable musical listening. Although the study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ligand-based positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, the experiment itself was rather straightforward. After screening 217 individuals who responded to advertisements down the subject pool to ten. They then asked the subjects to bring in their playlist and played them – while their brain activity was monitored from techno to tango – and played them while their brain activity was monitored. Because the scientists used combining methods (PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an impressively exact and detailed portrait of music in the brain. The first thing they discovered is that people's moods – by the neurons (nerve cells) in both the dorsal and ventral key role of the brain. As these two regions have long been linked with the experience of pleasure, this finding isn't particularly surprising.\nWhat is rather more significant is the finding that the dopamine neurons in the caudate – a region of the brain involved in anticipating and other brain reward stimuli – were at their most responsive around 15 seconds before the participants' favourite moments in the music. The researchers call this the anticipatory phase and argue that the question, of course, is what all these dopamine neurons are up to. Why are they so active in the period preceding the acoustic climax? After all, we typically associate surges of dopamine with the processing of actual rewards. And yet, this pattern is still unresolved when the chills have yet to arrive and when the melodic pattern is still unresolved.\nOne way to answer the question is to look at the music and not the brain. While music can often seem (at least to the outsider) like a labyrinth of intricate patterns, it turns out that the most important part of every song or symphony is when the pattern breaks down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. If the music is too obvious, it is annoyingly boring, like an alarm clock. Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated that dopamine neurons quickly adapt to predictable rewards. If we know what's going to happen next, then we don't get excited. This is why composers often introduce a key note at the beginning of a song, spend most of the song avoiding it, and then finally repeat the greater emotional release when the pattern returns, safe and sound.\nTo demonstrate this psychological principle, the musicologist Leonard Meyer, in his classic book <em>Emotion and Meaning in Music</em> (1956), analyzed the 5th movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131. Meyer expects to show how Beethoven begins with the clear measures (bars) of the masterwork, showing how Beethoven begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern. He wants to preserve an element of uncertainty in his music, making our brains beg for the one chord he refuses to give us. Beethoven saves that chord for the end.\nAccording to Meyer, it is the suspenseful tension of music, arising out of unfulfilled expectations, that is the source can refer to the music's real world. While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound source of the music's feeling. While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound can refer to the music's real world images and experiences – its 'connotative' meaning – Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the unfolding events of the music itself. This 'embodied meaning' arises from the patterns dopamine in the caudate, as we struggle to anticipate what will happen next. We can predict some of the notes, but we can't predict them all, and that's what keeps us listening, waiting for the pattern to be completed.`,

    title: 'The Power of Smell',
    subtitle: 'How our sense of smell works and its surprising influence on our emotions',
    passage: `Research shows that our olfactory sense is more influential than we realise\n<strong>A</strong> Dog noses are renowned for sensitivity to smells, while human noses are thought to be poor by comparison, yet that might be a misconception. According to recent studies, our noses are in fact acutely sensitive instruments that guide our everyday life to a surprising extent. Subtle smells can change your mood, behaviour and the choices you make, often without you realising it. Our own odours meanwhile, indicate emotional states such as fear or sadness to those around us. The big mystery is why we aren't more aware of our nasal activity. Noses have certainly never been at the forefront of sensory research, and were pushed aside until recently in favour of the seemingly more vital senses of vision and hearing. 'There has been a lot of prejudice that people are not that influenced by olfactory stimuli, especially compared to other mammals,' says Lilianne Mujica-Parodi, who studies the neurobiology of human stress at Stony Brook University in New York, in the United States.\n<strong>B</strong> One of the first people to assert the relative unimportance of human smelling was Pierre Paul Broca, an influential 19th-century anatomist. After comparing the proportion of the brain devoted to smell in different animals, he suggested that mammals can be classed into two broad groups: macrosmatic mammals, such as dogs, have a finely tuned sense of smell which they rely on to perceive the world, while we, along with other primates and the marine mammals, are microsmatic – we have small olfactory organs that we only rely on to a small extent. That idea seemed to fit with more recent studies which found that the majority of mammals have genes coding for about 1000 different types of smell receptor. Most of these genes aren't expressed in humans, giving our noses just 400 different types of receptor.\n<strong>C</strong> Yet these findings may have been misleading. Brain scans now show that more of the brain is devoted to smell processing than Broca's anatomical studies suggested. And although we may have fewer types of receptor than other mammals, Charles Greer at Yale University in the United States has shown that the human nose and brain are unusually well connected, with each group of receptors linking to many more neural regions than is the case in other animals. That should give us a good ability to process incoming scents. Once researchers began looking, they found the nose to be far more sensitive than its reputation suggested. One study, for example, found that we can detect certain chemicals diluted in water to less than one part per billion. That means that a person can detect just a few drops of a strong smell like ethyl mercaptan in an Olympic-sized pool.\n<strong>D</strong> 'We are also exceptionally gifted at telling smells apart, even in the case of two molecules whose only difference is that their structures are mirror images of one another. That is fantastic sensitivity', says George Dodd, a perfumer and researcher at the olfaction group of the University of Warwick, in the United Kingdom. What's more, it's becoming clear that the brain’s olfactory centres are intimately linked to its limbic system, which is involved in emotion, fear and memory. That suggests a link between smell and the way we think.\n<strong>E</strong> The power of smell will be no news to estate agents, who often advocate the smell of baking bread or brewing coffee to promote the sale of a house. But there are more subtle and surprising effects too. When Hendrick Schifferstein and colleagues, from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, pumped the smell of orange, seawater or peppermint into a nightclub, the revellers danced more, rated their night as more enjoyable, and even thought the music was better than when there was no added scent. Meanwhile, Rob Holland, of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, found that the hint of aroma wafting out of a hidden bucket of citrus-scented cleaner was enough to persuade students in a hostel to clean up after themselves.\n<strong>F</strong> Other work has found that scent can influence our cognitive skills. A study by William Overman and colleagues at the University of North Carolina in the United States found that when men were subjected to a novel smell – either good or bad – during a task used to test decision-making skills, they performed significantly worse than normal. The researchers conclude the scent stimulated brain areas connected with emotion, making their decisions emotional rather than rational.\n<strong>G</strong> Smells are especially good memory evokers, but it is actually a myth that odours trigger more detailed memories than other stimuli. 'The memory is not more accurate and you don't remember more details,' says Yaara Yeshurun at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, 'but it is unique in that it is more emotional.' This isn't surprising when you consider that there are certain brain areas dedicated to both emotion and olfaction, such as the amygdala. and there is a strong link between emotion and memory. In 2009, Yeshurun found that the link between a memory and a smell is stronger if the smell is unpleasant rather than pleasant. She also discovered that the very first time we attach a smell to an object, it evokes a much greater response in our brains than for any subsequent encounter with the smell or object, laying down stronger foundations for the memory. That doesn't happen with any other sense. Since those first encounters with a smell would have happened at a young age, this explains why smells often transport us back to our childhood.`,

    title: 'Roller coaster: the great fairground attraction',
    subtitle: 'The history and science behind the world\'s most thrilling amusement rides',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Like a passenger train, a roller coaster consists of a series of connected cars that move on a track. But unlike a passenger train, it has no engine or power source of its own. For most of the ride, it is moved only by the forces of inertia and gravity. The only exertion of energy occurs at the very beginning of the ride when the coaster train is pulled up the lift hill.\n<strong>B</strong> The traditional lifting mechanism is a long length of chain running up the hill under the track. The chain is fastened in a loop, which is wound around a gear at the top of the hill and another one at the bottom of the hill. The gear at the bottom of the hill is turned by a motor. This turns the chain so that it continually moves up the hill like a long conveyor belt. The coaster cars grip onto the chain, which simply pulls them to the top of the hill. At the summit, the train is released and starts its descent.\n<strong>C</strong> The purpose of this initial ascent is to build up a sort of reservoir of potential energy, which simply means that as the coaster gets higher in the air, there is a greater distance gravity can pull it down.\n<strong>D</strong> As the train starts coasting down the hill, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (energy of motion), and the train speeds up. At the bottom of the hill, this has reached its maximum, and this propels the train up the second hill, again building up the potential energy level.\n<strong>E</strong> In this way, the course of the track is constantly converting energy from kinetic to potential and back again. This fluctuation in acceleration is what makes roller coasters so much fun. At its most basic level, this is all a roller coaster is – a machine that uses gravity and inertia to send a train along a winding track.\n<strong>F</strong> Roller coasters have a long, fascinating history. Their direct ancestors were ice slides, popular in Russia in the 16th and 17th centuries. They consisted of a long, steep, wooden slide covered in ice. Riders walked up a ladder or set of stairs to the top of the slide, as high as 21 meters up. At the top, they climbed into sleds made out of wood or blocks of ice and shot down the slope. At the base of the slide, the sleds would crash-land in a sand pile.\n<strong>G</strong> It seems that the idea was then imported into France. For most of the year, the warmer climate would melt the ice, so the French started building waxed slides instead. To help the sleds move down these slides, they added wheels, and in 1817, for the first time, a train was attached to the track. The French continued to expand on this idea, coming up with more complex track layouts, with multiple cars and all sorts of twists and turns.\n<strong>H</strong> The first American roller coaster was built in the mountains of Pennsylvania in the mid-1800s originally to provide an easy way to send coal to the railway 29 km down to mountain. When the track was first built, a crew at the bottom of the mountain would attach the cart to a team of mules after emptying the load, and the mules would drag it back up to the top. They were eventually replaced with steam engines, to make the system more efficient.\n<strong>I</strong> Soon after these improvements were made, the railway company built a new tunnel that brought the freight trains much closer to the coal mine. Now no longer required for its original purpose, the roller coaster was configured as a 'scenic tour'. For one dollar, tourists got a leisurely ride up to the top of the mountain, followed by a wild, bumpy ride straight down. This was soon a resounding success, attracting thousands of tourists every year.\n<strong>J</strong> Scenic rides like this continued to thrive and were joined by wooden roller coasters similar to the ones we know today. These coasters were the main attraction at popular amusement parks throughout the United States, such as the many parks of Coney Island in New York. By the 1920s, roller coasters were in full swing, with some 2,000 rides in operation around the country. Following the Great Depression, a decline in roller coaster production began in the early 1930s but a second roller-coaster boom in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s revitalized the amusement park industry, and introduced a slew of innovative tubular steel coasters.\n<strong>K</strong> This was followed by a decline in interest for the rest of the decade, but since the early 1990s the amusement-park industry has experienced another coaster boom of sorts. New launching techniques and other technological developments have opened up a world of options for designers so in some rides you feel as if you are flying. In the next few years we can expect to see many faster, taller and more twisted rides popping up in amusement parks around the world.`,

    title: 'The Impact of Invasive Species',
    subtitle: 'How non-native species threaten biodiversity and what can be done about it',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> Invasive species are among the leading threats to the native wildlife of most countries, with approximately 42 percent of endangered species at risk from them. Invasive species can be any kind of organism—for example, a mammal, amphibian, fish, insect, or plant—that is not native to an ecosystem. Often, they reproduce and spread with great speed. Contrary to popular belief, a plant or animal classified as an invasive species does not necessarily originate in another country. For example, lake trout are native to the Great Lakes of North America but are considered an invasive species in Yellowstone Lake in Wyoming because they compete with native cutthroat trout for habitat.\n<strong>B</strong> When a new species is introduced into an ecosystem, native wildlife may struggle to compete with it for food and other resources. Invasive species can change the food web in an ecosystem by destroying or replacing native food sources while providing little or no food for local wildlife. In extreme cases, the invader may prey on the native species. Above all, invasive species threaten biodiversity in many habitats. For instance, the climbing plant species kudzu (which is native to East Asia) can easily replace a habitat that had a wide range of plants with a monoculture consisting solely of kudzu, as has started to happen in the southeast of the USA.\n<strong>C</strong> The phenomenon is not an exclusively modern one. Humans have always transferred a variety of species from one region to another, but the development of rapid means of transportation has increased the frequency of such introductions. Aquatic organisms can be shipped across the oceans, while insects can easily get into the wooden crates that are transported around the world in this way. In addition, climate change has enabled some invasive plant species to colonize new areas. Other invasive species include pets such as snakes or turtles, which are intentionally set free into the wild.\n<strong>D</strong> Invasive species do not all present the same level of threat to native ecosystems and can be classified into three types. The first of these may be introduced species that can maintain themselves in a limited range of habitats without upsetting the ecological equilibrium of the area. Some scientists have even argued that, in these cases, the introduction enhances the diversity of animal and plant life in that specific area. A second group of invaders presents a greater threat because their spread is at the expense of one native species. The North American grey squirrel, for example, was introduced to the UK in 1876 largely because wealthy landowners thought it would be a fashionable and attractive addition to the local wildlife on their estates. It spread widely, leading directly to the dramatic decline in the population of the native red squirrel. However, it would appear that this is the only definite negative impact of the grey squirrel.\n<strong>E</strong> There is a third level of threat in which the dominance of the introduced species has an extremely destructive effect on the entire ecosystem. One of the most damaging examples involved a species of comb jellyfish. Native to estuaries along the western Atlantic coast from the northern United States to the Valdés Peninsula in Argentina, this species was released from a ship into the Black Sea in Eastern Europe in 1982, almost certainly by accident. The Black Sea has levels of industrial waste that are, by international standards, exceptionally high. Despite this, fishing boats were still able to catch healthy numbers of fish. But when the invading jellyfish underwent a population explosion in the space of just six years, the entire marine ecosystem was transformed, and fish numbers declined dramatically because they were in competition with the jellyfish, preying on exactly the same microscopic creatures. The jellyfish had a more serious impact on the ecosystem than the heavily polluted water.\n<strong>F</strong> More than a century after its introduction outside its native range on the Amazon River in South America, a plant known as a water hyacinth can be found in tropical lakes, streams, and rivers around the world. Its beauty attracted botanists seeking exotic plants for botanical gardens, and they imported it to a horticultural exhibition in New Orleans in 1884. Visitors were so impressed that they planted it in many locations during the 1880s and 1890s, resulting in the aquatic ecosystems of the southeastern United States being progressively colonized by vast, floating, dense carpets of water hyacinth. Today, it is present around the globe, damaging boat engines and even blocking cooling pipes for power plants, occasionally leading to massive blackouts. The impact of the water hyacinth on native water plants is largely unstudied, as is unfortunately the case for most ecosystems invaded by new plant species.\n<strong>G</strong> In the United States, more than 7,000 introduced species have established themselves, of which at least 15 percent cause ecological damage. As the number of invasive species expands, legislation to deal with this problem is rare or non-existent in the majority of countries. Unfortunately, ordinary people outside the scientific community have a very limited understanding of the threat posed by invasive species, which means that other environmental threats receive considerably more media attention. The introduction of new species can initially seem highly desirable, but the full extent of their impact is consistently underestimated.\n<strong>H</strong> Although ultimately, measures need to be taken at an international level, limited action is possible by individuals. One way is for people to plant native plants in their gardens rather than species from abroad. It is also useful to learn to identify invasive species and report any sightings to wildlife organizations. Regularly cleaning clothing, boots, boats, tires, and any other equipment regularly used outdoors can remove insects and plant parts that may introduce invasive species into new locations.`,

    title: 'Orientation of birds',
    subtitle: 'How birds find their way during long-distance migrations',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> For many of us, the way birds are able to orientate is both astounding and difficult to appreciate fully. For instance, the annual migration of the golden plover of the Pacific takes it from Alaska to Hawaii on a flight of well over 3000 kilometres, and if it were to deviate by only one degree, it would miss the island on which it nests.\n<strong>B</strong> The first systematic studies on orientation in birds were made possible by the 'homing instinct' exhibited by so many species. Birds are caught at a time when they show an attachment to their territory, especially during the nesting season. They are taken to some spot, released, and the percentage of returns is recorded. The distance can be varied, and the direction, as well as the method of transporting them, and then the influence of climatic and other factors on their ability to find their way home can be studied. These experiments have shown a wide variation in ability to home, and three types of homing behaviour have been identified.\n<strong>C</strong> In the first type, birds methodically explore the area in which they are released until they pick up some familiar feature, and then they quickly find their way back to the nest. Such birds possess a highly developed visual memory, as experiments with pigeons have shown. Domestic pigeons have been trained to peck at a certain point on an aerial photograph, with a system of rewards, and four years later the birds were still able to respond to this training when placed on the aerial photograph. Birds' eyes have a power of resolution two to three times greater than ours, enabling them to pick up very fine details. If a bird uses only this type of homing behaviour, however, it can only succeed if the point of release is not too far away. If the birds are transported 800 kilometres from their nest, it is only by good fortune that they find their way back as a result of long exploratory flights. Usually, the area known to a bird is its feeding territory. Released within this area, the birds soon make their return; release them outside it and far fewer return. However, if a bird is released for a second time in the same place, its visual memory comes into play, and the bird, no longer requiring tedious exploratory flights, will return much more quickly.\n<strong>D</strong> The second type of homing behaviour is shown by birds that are capable of choosing their flight direction and holding to it for the rest of their journey. How do they decide what direction to take? They appear to choose their normal migration direction even if they are released in a different place from their usual starting point. For example, birds which normally fly to the north-east to reach latitude 45 degrees north are released at that latitude, they will immediately start flying north-east anyway. So if they're released further to the west, they'll maintain the correct direction, but fly west of their destination, and so fail to arrive.\n<strong>E</strong> The third type of homing behaviour shows the highest degree of orientation. Released at one point, the birds immediately take stock of it, compare its position with that of the nest, decide on the direction and fly off. This happens even if the birds are in a country right off their migration routes, where they have never been before. In one example, a laysan albatross returned to its nesting area on Midway Island in the middle of the Pacific, having flown over 5000 kilometres from the west coast of the USA in just over ten days. This is a perfect example of the third type of homing, for the albatross clearly couldn't rely on any landmarks over the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.\n<strong>F</strong> The percentage of successful birds varies greatly, being highest in those species with a strong migratory behaviour. Thus the lesser black-backed gull is more migratory than the herring gull and more often reaches 'home'. Great migrants such as the swift have the highest percentage of returns. In one case, seven out of nine alpine swifts were recaptured at their nests after being displaced some 1400 kilometres; one made the journey in three days.\n<strong>G</strong> What part does heredity play in all this? Two research studies suggest that instinctive, i.e. genetically inherited, behaviour patterns play a part in navigation. The first was carried out by Ernst Schuz and it is highly significant. Schuz caught first year European storks and released them later, after the departure of the adult storks at a time when they normally make their south-west autumn migration to Africa. The recaptures showed that, in spite of the fact that there were no adults to guide them, the birds unanimously headed south-west. This was a most striking finding, for it showed that the birds had an innate and unlearned attraction for the African wintering area that they have occupied for thousands of years.\n<strong>H</strong> The case of starlings is a little different. These birds have a great aptitude for homing, but this behaviour differs in the different age groups. Birds that were shifted to the south-east of their normal migration route split into two lots. The adults, in full possession of their gift for orientation, found their wintering area by modifying their direction by 90 degrees, whereas the juveniles sought their winter quarters to the south-east of their real position.`,

    title: 'The Remarkable Power of Placebos',
    subtitle: 'How inactive substances can produce real medical benefits',
    passage: `<strong>A</strong> It's one of our most powerful medical treatments, and certainly our most widely effective. In recent years, it's been found to help help or lessen the symptoms associated with clinical depression, irritable bowel syndrome, panic attacks, coughing, and ADHD, among other conditions. This name of this wonderful treatment? It's the 'placebo effect,' the remarkable power of the human brain to unconsciously influence the functioning and perception of the body.\n<strong>B</strong> The term, which is Latin for 'I shall please,' was first used sometime during the 1700s, but the concept itself dates back centuries. Historically, doctors believed that one of their key duties, in addition to curing a patient, was to console him or her, providing a boost to the morale that could help them to get better faster - sometimes in the form of a dummy medicine that had no effect beyond instilling the expectation of improvement in the patient's brain. It's now widely recognized that, while largely ineffective in improving objective symptoms, such as high blood pressure or an infection, for instance, placebos are genuinely effective in treating subjective, self-reported symptoms, including all sorts of pain. Placebos can take all sorts of forms: inert sugar pills, sham surgeries, and saline injections.\n<strong>C</strong> The singular power of expectations has been demonstrated in a variety of studies. In one, for example, patients given a placebo pill that is referred to as a muscle relaxer will experience muscle relaxation, while those given a placebo called a muscle stimulator will experience muscle tension. The flip side of the placebo, the nocebo effect, is just as powerful - negative expectations can cause as much harm as positive ones can do good. In other studies, it's been shown that pills which are red, yellow, or orange in color are more likely to provide a stimulating effect, while blue and green ones are more often perceived as sedating. One study even found that bigger pills are better when it comes to placebo performance.\n<strong>D</strong> The science that underlies all of these studies isn't well understood at this point. Scientists have conducted some imaging research into the brain on placebos, and they've found that ingestion of a placebo billed as a painkiller leads to increased activity in several areas of the cerebral cortex, as compared to an actual painkiller. These areas are involved in so-called 'higher' functions like memory, attention, thought, and consciousness. A pain-killing placebo, it seems, works differently from a painkiller.\n<strong>E</strong> In a recent headache study, conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School, 66 participants who suffer from chronic migraines were given six envelopes, each containing a pill to be taken after their next migraine attack. Two envelopes were labelled 'Maxalt' - the brand name for the widely used migraine drug rizatriptan - in order to generate positive expectations, while two had no label, to produce neutral expectations, and two were labelled 'placebo,' to generate negative expectations. But for each of the three labels, one envelope held a genuine rizatriptan pill, and one contained a placebo. This allowed the researchers to cross-compare the effectiveness of rizatriptan + positive expectations, rizatriptan alone, and rizatriptan + negative expectations, as well as positive, neutral, and negative expectations in isolation.\n<strong>F</strong> When the scientists analyzed the participants' self-reported pain reductions after taking the pills, the power of the placebo was proven yet again. People who'd taken a placebo pill labelled Maxalt got just as much pain relief as those who'd taken a Maxalt pill labelled as a placebo. Additionally, people who took a Maxalt correctly labelled as Maxalt reported about twice as much pain reduction as those who took a Maxalt pill labelled as placebo. In other words, in treating a complex, chronic form of pain like migraine, the effectiveness of pure expectations was roughly equal to the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical itself\n<strong>G</strong> For a doctor, harnessing the placebo's power doesn't mean intentionally mislabelling pills. Instead, a doctor could simply provide a slightly more positive message about a treatment, lending the power of expectations to that of pharmaceuticals. "When doctors set patients' expectations high, Maxalt becomes more effective," lead author of the study Rami Burstein said in a press statement. Of course, this sort of intentional expectation-setting needs to be done carefully. Doctors have an ethical obligation not to mislead patients or withhold important information. But that doesn't mean that making sure to provide subtle positive cues about the effectiveness of a medication especially when those very cues might well make it work more effectively — is a bad idea. As Ted Kaptchuk, one of the study's co-authors, put it, "the placebo effect is an unacknowledged partner for powerful medications."`,
