    questions: [
      { q: "What skills do you think will be most important in the future?", answer: "That's a great question. I'd say adaptability is probably the biggest one – you know, being able to learn new things quickly because technology keeps changing everything. And honestly, I think critical thinking will matter a lot too. Like, with AI doing more routine work, humans need to focus on creative problem-solving." },
      { q: "Why do some people find it harder to learn new skills than others?", answer: "Well, there are a few reasons. Some people have this fear of failing which holds them back. Others might've had bad experiences in school. And let's be honest – if you're working full-time and have kids, finding time to learn something new is really tough." },
      { q: "Do you think schools focus enough on practical skills?", answer: "Mm, not really, in my opinion. I left school not knowing how to do taxes or manage money properly. Schools teach lots of theory, but there's definitely a gap when it comes to real-world stuff like communication skills or working with other people." },
      { q: "Is it better to learn skills formally through courses or informally by yourself?", answer: "I think it depends on what you're learning. For something like coding, you can totally teach yourself online. But for other things – medicine, obviously – you need proper training. Personally, I like a mix. Get the basics from a course, then practice on your own." }

    relatedPart2: 2,
    questions: [
      { q: "Why do some people enjoy being in crowded places while others don't?", answer: "I think it's mostly about personality. Some people – extroverts – get energised by busy environments. They love the buzz. Others find it draining. I'm somewhere in between, actually. It also depends on the situation – a concert crowd feels different from being stuck in a packed train." },
      { q: "How do you think cities can deal with overcrowding?", answer: "There's no easy fix, is there? But better public transport would help massively. And encouraging people to work from home – that's already made a difference. Some places are trying to spread things out more, so not everything's crammed into one central area." },
      { q: "Do you think overcrowding affects people's mental health?", answer: "Yeah, I think it definitely can. When you never get personal space, it's bound to stress you out. I've read that people in really crowded housing feel more anxious. Though humans are pretty adaptable – city dwellers seem to find ways to cope." },
      { q: "Are there benefits to living in densely populated areas?", answer: "Oh, absolutely. More people means more restaurants, more shops, better transport. And there's the social side – you meet all sorts of different people. Plus, funnily enough, it can be more environmentally friendly because you don't need a car." }

    questions: [
      { q: "Why do some people like helping others?", answer: "Well, honestly, it just feels good, doesn't it? There's that warm feeling you get when you help someone out. For some people it's religious or cultural values. And people who've struggled themselves are often more likely to help others in similar situations." },
      { q: "Do you think governments should do more to help people in need?", answer: "That's tricky because it depends where you draw the line. I mean, yes, there should be a safety net – for people who genuinely can't help themselves. But you don't want to create dependency either. The best programs help people get back on their feet." },
      { q: "Is it important to teach children to help others?", answer: "Definitely. Kids who learn to think about others tend to grow into more empathetic adults. It's best learned by doing – volunteering together as a family, that sort of thing. Schools can help too, but I think it starts at home really." },
      { q: "How has technology changed the way people help each other?", answer: "Massively! Think about crowdfunding – you can help someone on the other side of the world. Social media spreads awareness quickly. Though I do worry sometimes that people just share things and feel like they've done their bit, when nothing much has changed." }

      { q: "Do you think people read less now than in the past?", answer: "It's interesting, actually. People probably read fewer books, but we're constantly reading – texts, emails, social media, articles. The difference is the depth. We skim a lot more than we used to. Whether that's worse depends on how you look at it." },
      { q: "Why do some people prefer e-books while others prefer physical books?", answer: "E-books are just so convenient – you can carry hundreds on one device. But there's something about holding a real book, isn't there? The feel of it, seeing how far you've got. I use both – e-books when travelling, real books at home." },
      { q: "How can parents encourage children to read more?", answer: "The biggest thing is leading by example – if kids see parents reading, they're more likely to pick it up. Making books accessible, letting them choose what they want. And limiting screen time helps too, obviously." },
      { q: "Do you think bookshops will survive in the future?", answer: "I hope so! The ones doing well seem to create an experience – nice café, author events, helpful staff. You can't get that from Amazon. Big chains might struggle, but local independent bookshops with loyal customers should be alright." }

    questions: [
      { q: "Do you think ambitious people are more likely to succeed?", answer: "Generally yes, but it depends how you define success. Ambitious people set bigger goals and work harder. But someone with modest goals who achieves them and is happy – isn't that success too? Plus, extreme ambition without principles can lead to harmful things." },
      { q: "Why do some people give up on their goals easily?", answer: "Often it's because they set unrealistic goals to begin with. Or they didn't plan properly – big dream but no actual steps. Life gets in the way too. Sometimes giving up isn't failure though – it's just realising something isn't right for you." },
      { q: "How important is it to have long-term goals in life?", answer: "I think having some direction is important – otherwise you're just drifting. But holding on too rigidly can be a problem. Life changes, you change. Having a general direction but being flexible about how you get there seems best." },
      { q: "Should parents set goals for their children?", answer: "They should help children develop goal-setting skills, definitely. But imposing specific goals – like 'you must be a doctor' – that's problematic. Kids need to find their own path. Parents can support whatever interests emerge, but goals should come from the child." }

    questions: [
      { q: "Do you think celebrities make good role models?", answer: "Some do, some don't. There are celebrities who use their fame for good. But celebrity culture often promotes shallow values – looks, money, fame. I think better role models are usually people you actually know, who you can see dealing with real life." },
      { q: "Why do people need role models?", answer: "We're social creatures – we learn by watching others. Role models show us what's possible and give us something to aspire to. They're especially important for young people or anyone trying to achieve something in a field where they don't see people like themselves." },
      { q: "How has social media changed the way we think about inspiration?", answer: "It's a double-edged sword. You can find inspiration from ordinary people sharing their journeys. But there's so much fake perfection – highlight reels that make everyone feel inadequate. Sometimes people scroll through inspirational content instead of actually doing anything." },
      { q: "Can people be inspired by failure as well as success?", answer: "Absolutely – maybe even more so. Seeing how someone bounces back from failure is way more useful than watching someone succeed effortlessly. Failure stories are relatable. They show the path isn't straight and setbacks aren't the end." }

The sources have multiplied too. Anyone can become a news source now, which has good and bad sides." },
      { q: "Do you think social media is a reliable source of news?", answer: "Generally, no. Things spread because they're sensational, not because they're accurate. There's no fact-checking before something goes viral. Social media can surface stories media ignores though. The key is verifying things before believing them." },
      { q: "Is it important for people to keep up with current events?", answer: "To some extent – you need to know enough to vote sensibly. But constantly following news, especially negative news, isn't healthy. I try to stay informed without becoming obsessed with checking headlines every hour." },
      { q: "How can people identify fake news?", answer: "Check the source – is it reputable? Look for the same story elsewhere. Be suspicious of anything that makes you really emotional – fake news is designed to provoke. And honestly, just slow down before sharing." }

    questions: [
      { q: "How should society treat elderly people?", answer: "With respect and dignity, obviously. But also recognising they still have lots to contribute. It's about balance between providing care and not treating them like children. Loneliness is huge for older people, so including them in society matters." },
      { q: "Why do some cultures respect the elderly more than others?", answer: "In traditional societies, older people held valuable knowledge. In fast-changing modern cultures, there's this attitude that older people are out of touch. Religious and family values play a role too. Extended families naturally keep generations connected." },
      { q: "Do you think life is better for old people now than in the past?", answer: "In some ways – healthcare is better, people live longer and healthier. But there's more isolation now. Older people used to live with families; now many live alone. So physically better off, perhaps, but socially more complicated." },
      { q: "What problems do elderly people face in modern society?", answer: "Loneliness is a big one – it can literally make you sick. Technology can be a barrier too; everything's online but not everyone can keep up. Financial worries, inadequate care options, age discrimination... it's quite a long list unfortunately." }

But over-tourism can ruin the very places people want to see. Local prices go up, traditional communities get displaced. It's about finding a balance." },
      { q: "How has tourism changed over the past few decades?", answer: "It's become so much more accessible. Budget airlines, online booking – travel used to be for the wealthy, now ordinary families can go abroad. Social media changed things too – places become famous overnight because of Instagram." },
      { q: "Do you think tourism will change in the future?", answer: "Probably. Climate concerns might make people think twice about long flights. Sustainable tourism is growing – people want authentic experiences, not just ticking off famous sites. Virtual reality might play a role, though I'm not sure it could replace actually being somewhere." },
      { q: "Is ecotourism really good for the environment?", answer: "In theory, yes – if done properly. Real ecotourism funds conservation and educates visitors. But the term gets used as marketing when reality doesn't match. Getting tourists to pristine areas inevitably has some impact, even with good intentions." }

And modern life makes it worse – we can get almost anything immediately. Fast food, streaming, same-day delivery. Some people naturally have more patience than others too." },
      { q: "Do you think patience is a skill that can be learned?", answer: "Yeah, I think so. Meditation seems to help people become more patient. Even just practising waiting – putting your phone away instead of checking it constantly – can build tolerance. It's uncomfortable at first but you get better." },
      { q: "Has technology made people less patient?", answer: "Almost certainly. When you can Google anything instantly, waiting even a few seconds feels annoying. Social media conditions us to expect constant stimulation. Though some apps try to help with patience – meditation apps, for example." },
      { q: "Are there situations where being impatient is actually a good thing?", answer: "Definitely. Impatience with injustice drives social change. In emergencies, you need to act fast. And in competitive situations, being too patient means missing opportunities. It's about knowing when patience is a virtue and when it's not." }

Though younger generations seem to value work-life balance more. There's still pressure from older generations though, and success tends to be materialistically defined." },
      { q: "What factors contribute to people achieving their goals?", answer: "Hard work matters, obviously, but so does luck and circumstance – where you're born, what opportunities you have. Support systems help too – having people who believe in you. And setting realistic goals with clear steps rather than vague dreams." },
      { q: "Do you think successful people have a responsibility to help others?", answer: "I think there's something to that, yeah. If you've benefited from society or luck, giving something back seems right. But it shouldn't be forced. The best help comes from genuinely wanting to, not from obligation." },
      { q: "Is it possible to be successful without working hard?", answer: "Some people get lucky – inherit money, win the lottery. But usually, even 'overnight successes' have years of hard work behind them. Sustainable success almost always involves effort. Whether pure luck counts as real success is another question." }

And honestly, working with others is often more enjoyable – you can bounce ideas around, share the load when things get tough." },
      { q: "How can conflicts be resolved when people work together?", answer: "Communication is key – talking things through before they escalate. Trying to understand where the other person's coming from rather than just defending your position. Sometimes you need someone neutral to help see the issue differently." },
      { q: "Are some people naturally better at teamwork than others?", answer: "Probably. Some people just find it easier to collaborate, to let others take credit. But I think teamwork skills can be learned too. Someone quite individualistic can become better at teamwork with practice and the right environment." },
      { q: "Do you think schools prepare students well for working in teams?", answer: "There's more group work now, which is good. But often one person ends up doing all the work, which defeats the purpose. Good team projects need structure and accountability. Some schools do it well, others not so much." }

      { q: "Do you think people spend too much money on unnecessary things?", answer: "A lot of people do, yeah. Advertising is so good at making you feel like you need stuff. And social media creates pressure to have the latest things. But what's 'unnecessary' is subjective – one person's waste might be another's joy." },
      { q: "Should parents give children money as pocket money?", answer: "I think so. It's a good way to teach money management. Kids can learn about saving, making choices, dealing with consequences. The amount matters less than having consistency and talking about money openly." },
      { q: "Why do some people save money while others prefer to spend it immediately?", answer: "Some of it's personality – some people are naturally cautious. Upbringing plays a role too – if your parents were savers, you probably picked that up. And your financial situation matters – it's easier to save when basics are covered." },
      { q: "Do you think attitudes towards money differ between generations?", answer: "Definitely. Older generations tend to be more careful, having lived through tougher times perhaps. Younger people are accused of being frivolous, but they face different challenges – house prices, job security. Priorities shift." }

Being around trees and greenery calms people down. And I think there's something deeper – we evolved in nature, and modern life can feel very artificial." },
      { q: "Do you think enough is being done to protect the environment?", answer: "Honestly, no. There's lots of talk and some action, but the scale of the problem is huge and responses feel slow. Individual efforts help, but without big changes from governments and corporations, it's not enough." },
      { q: "How can we encourage people to be more environmentally conscious?", answer: "Making it easy helps – good recycling systems, affordable public transport. Education from a young age. And honestly, seeing consequences makes people care more. When people experience extreme weather, they start taking climate change seriously." },
      { q: "What are the main environmental problems facing your country?", answer: "Air pollution in cities is big. Waste management – too much going to landfill. Water quality in some areas. And like everywhere, we're contributing to climate change. There's been progress but plenty more to do." }

    questions: [
      { q: "Why do some people resist change?", answer: "Change is uncomfortable – it means leaving familiar territory. Some people are naturally more risk-averse. And sometimes resistance is sensible – not all change is good. People often push back when change is imposed rather than chosen." },
      { q: "Do you think all changes in society have been positive?", answer: "Definitely not. Some changes bring problems we didn't anticipate. Social media connected us but created new mental health issues. Economic changes lifted many out of poverty but increased inequality. Progress is messy and mixed." },
      { q: "How do people adapt to major changes in their lives?", answer: "It varies hugely. Some people are naturally adaptable; others struggle more. Support from family and friends helps. Time helps too – even big changes become normal eventually. Having some control over the change makes a difference." },
      { q: "Is technological progress always beneficial?", answer: "Not always. Every technology can be used well or badly. Nuclear energy can power cities or destroy them. The internet educates but also spreads misinformation. We need to think more carefully about how we use technology." }

      { q: "Do you think face-to-face communication is still important?", answer: "Absolutely. You miss so much without it – body language, tone, real presence. Deep relationships are hard to build through screens alone. Most people feel this, which is why we still meet up despite being able to video call." },
      { q: "Why do some people find it difficult to express themselves?", answer: "Confidence is a big factor – fear of being judged or misunderstood. Some people just process internally rather than externally. Cultural and family backgrounds matter too – if you were discouraged from speaking up as a child, it's hard to start as an adult." },
      { q: "Is there too much communication in modern life?", answer: "Sometimes it feels like it, yeah. Constant pings and notifications can be exhausting. We're always reachable, which sounds good but can feel overwhelming. Learning to disconnect is becoming an important skill." }

      { q: "Should governments spend more money on science?", answer: "In my view, yes. Science funding is pretty low. Short-term thinking dominates politics, but science often needs long-term investment. Private companies won't fund everything because some research isn't immediately profitable but is still valuable." },
      { q: "Are there any areas of scientific research that concern you?", answer: "AI is both exciting and concerning – we're creating something potentially smarter than us without knowing where it leads. Genetic engineering raises ethical questions. Some weapons research is worrying. The problem is, you can't really stop knowledge from advancing." },
      { q: "Why are some people suspicious of scientists?", answer: "Sometimes scientists have been wrong, or science has been misused. People feel talked down to.

      { q: "Should governments fund the arts?", answer: "Some funding makes sense, especially for things that wouldn't survive commercially but have cultural value. Museums, community arts programs. But art that's popular should probably support itself. It's about balance." },
      { q: "Why do some people consider themselves not creative?", answer: "Often because school made them feel their creativity wasn't valued. There's this idea that creativity means painting or writing, but it appears in all sorts of ways – problem-solving, cooking, decorating. Most people are more creative than they realise." },

We sit at desks, healthy food is expensive and takes time to prepare, we're stressed. Unhealthy options are convenient and cheap and engineered to be addictive. It's not just about willpower – the environment matters." },
      { q: "Should governments do more to promote healthy living?", answer: "There's a role for government – making healthy choices easier and cheaper. But where's the line? People should have freedom to make their own choices. Maybe education and environment rather than banning things." },
      { q: "Do you think people are more health-conscious now than in the past?", answer: "In some ways, yes. More awareness of nutrition, more people exercising, fewer smokers. But we have new problems – screen time, sedentary jobs, mental health issues. So more conscious perhaps, but not necessarily healthier overall." },

It helps you understand the present and make better decisions. Plus it's just fascinating – human stories across time." },
      { q: "Should old traditions be preserved or allowed to fade away?", answer: "It depends on the tradition. Some are beautiful and meaningful and worth keeping. Others are harmful or just outdated. We shouldn't preserve things just because they're old. But losing all tradition means losing identity and connection to the past." },
      { q: "Do you think modern technology helps preserve cultural heritage?", answer: "In some ways, yes. You can digitise old documents, create virtual museum tours, record traditional music.

It's not fair to put all responsibility on individuals when governments and corporations have more power." },
      { q: "Should businesses be required to help their local communities?", answer: "There's something appealing about that, but required gets complicated. I think businesses that give back tend to do better anyway – good reputation, loyal employees. Maybe incentives rather than requirements work better." },
      { q: "Why do some people volunteer while others don't?", answer: "Time is the big barrier – not everyone has spare hours. Some volunteer because of values or because they enjoy the social side.

      { q: "Do you think wealthy people have more responsibility to help society?", answer: "In a way, yes – they have more capacity. And often their wealth came from using shared resources.

A mix of people but with community spirit. Clean streets. It's harder to define than you'd think – you know a good neighbourhood when you feel it." },
      { q: "How can communities become closer?", answer: "Shared spaces help – parks, community centres, local events. When people have reasons to interact, relationships form. Social media groups for local areas can help too. But it takes effort and someone willing to organise things." },
      { q: "Do you think community spirit has declined in recent years?", answer: "In some ways, maybe. People are busier, more mobile, spend time online. Fewer people know their neighbours well. But community can form differently now – online groups, interest-based rather than location-based. It's changing rather than just declining." },
      { q: "Should people be involved in local decision-making?", answer: "Definitely. Decisions affect people's daily lives, so they should have a say.

Some love the social aspect – watching with friends. And not everyone is athletic, but they can still appreciate sport." },
      { q: "Do you think professional athletes are paid too much?", answer: "It seems excessive sometimes, but they're paid what the market supports. Fans pay for tickets, sponsors pay for exposure. It's supply and demand. Whether society should value athletes over nurses... that's a bigger question." },
      { q: "Should schools focus more on physical education?", answer: "I think so, yes. Many kids don't get enough exercise, and habits form young. PE shouldn't just be about competition though – finding activities kids actually enjoy matters. Not everyone likes team sports, so variety is important." },
      { q: "How has technology changed the way people exercise?", answer: "Apps tracking everything, home workouts on YouTube, virtual cycling – so many options now. Wearables make people more aware of how much they move. But technology can also make us more sedentary, so it cuts both ways." }

      { q: "Why is learning English important in many countries?", answer: "It's the global language of business, science, the internet. Like it or not, English opens doors. Films, music, research papers – so much is in English. Countries where people speak English well tend to have economic advantages." },
      { q: "What is the best age to start learning a foreign language?", answer: "Younger is generally better – children's brains are more plastic, they pick up pronunciation easily. But adults can learn effectively too, especially if motivated. The best age to start is really just as soon as possible." },
      { q: "Do you think translation technology will make language learning unnecessary?", answer: "For basic communication, maybe it already has. But for real connection, for working deeply in another culture, machines aren't enough. There are nuances that don't translate. Languages won't become unnecessary, but reasons to learn them might shift." },
      { q: "How can languages be preserved in a globalised world?", answer: "Teaching them to children is crucial. Documentation and recording help. Making speakers proud of their heritage language. Government support for minority language education. Technology can actually help – apps for endangered languages, online communities." }

    questions: [
      { q: "What role does music play in different cultures?", answer: "Huge role. Music marks celebrations, rituals, mourning. It preserves stories and history. It brings people together. Every culture has music because it's so fundamental – it crosses language barriers and touches people emotionally in ways words can't." },
      { q: "Do you think music preferences are influenced by where you grow up?", answer: "Definitely. You absorb the music around you as a child. If your parents played classical or hip hop or folk, that shapes your taste. Though with streaming, people are exposed to more variety, so preferences might be less geographically determined now." },
      { q: "Has technology changed how people experience music?", answer: "Completely. We've gone from live only, to records, to CDs, to streaming anything instantly. Music is everywhere, which is amazing but also less special maybe. Going to concerts feels more valuable because it's a genuine experience." },
      { q: "Why do some music styles become popular worldwide while others remain local?", answer: "Catchy beats and simple melodies travel well. English language helps. Marketing and platforms matter – if Spotify pushes something, it spreads. Some music is tied to specific cultural contexts and doesn't translate well without that background." }

    questions: [
      { q: "Why is food such an important part of culture?", answer: "It's tied to identity, memory, tradition. Family recipes passed down, festival dishes, everyday meals. Food rituals bring people together. And honestly, we all have to eat, so it's natural it becomes meaningful. Food tells you a lot about a place." },
      { q: "Do you think globalisation has affected traditional cuisines?", answer: "Definitely. You can get almost any cuisine anywhere now, which is great for variety but maybe dilutes what's local. Some traditional dishes are disappearing as younger generations prefer international options. Though there's a counter-movement valuing local food too." },
      { q: "Should parents teach their children how to cook?", answer: "Absolutely. Cooking is a basic life skill. It's healthier and cheaper than ready meals. And there's the cultural aspect – recipes and traditions passed down. Plus cooking together is a nice way to spend time with kids." },
      { q: "Why are some people willing to spend a lot of money on food?", answer: "For some it's about quality – genuinely better ingredients and skill. Social status plays a role too. The experience matters – ambiance, service, novelty. And for food enthusiasts, it's a hobby they're willing to invest in." }

    questions: [
      { q: "How dependent are people on technology nowadays?", answer: "Very. Try living without your phone for a day – most people would struggle. We rely on technology for communication, navigation, work, entertainment, shopping... everything really. Whether that dependency is good or bad is debatable, but it's definitely real." },
      { q: "Do you think technology has made life better or worse?", answer: "Both, honestly. Medical advances, access to information, connecting with people worldwide – clearly better. But mental health issues from social media, privacy concerns, job losses to automation – real downsides. Technology is neutral; it's how we use it that matters." },
      { q: "Are there any technologies you think we would be better off without?", answer: "That's hard because most have good and bad uses. Maybe some social media features that are deliberately addictive? Weapons of mass destruction, obviously. But even then... the knowledge can't be unlearned. It's about how we choose to use technology." },
      { q: "How do you think technology will change daily life in the future?", answer: "AI will be everywhere – assistants, automation, maybe companions. Probably more virtual and augmented reality. Working from anywhere will be normal. But I hope we keep some tech-free spaces too. The trend seems to be more integration of technology into everything." }
