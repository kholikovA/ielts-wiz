    title: 'A Survivor\'s Story',
    subtitle: 'One native bird in New Zealand that has managed to survive the introduction of non-native species',
    passage: `<p>As an island country with a fauna dominated by birds, New Zealand was once home to an owl species which is now extinct, the laughing owl, named for its distinctive cry. This bird was widespread throughout the islands when European settlers arrived in the middle of the 19th century and it remained in good numbers for some years thereafter. Where other native birds suffered from predation by the Polynesian rat, the laughing owl turned the tables and adapted its diet to include the rodent. It was also capable of catching and killing the other New Zealand owl, the morepork, and even larger birds, such as the weka. However, the laughing owl was wiped out around the beginning of the 20th century. Its demise caused by specimen collectors, habitat changes, and non-native predators including cats and stoats. Surprisingly, it is the smaller owl, the morepork, that has managed to survive until this day.</p>
<p>Speckled dark brown, with yellow eyes and long tails, they are around 29 centimeters long from head to tail and 175 grams in weight. Moreporks have fringes on the edge of their feathers, so they can fly almost silently and not alert potential prey. They have acute hearing and their large eyes are very sensitive to light.</p>
<p>Moreporks nest in tree hollows, in clumps of plants, or in cavities among rocks and roots. In the wild, moreporks usually start nesting in October, although zoo specimens have been recorded nesting in midwinter, possibly stimulated by an ample food supply. The female lays up to three white eggs, which she incubates for 20 to 30 days. During this time, she rarely hunts, and the male brings food to her. Once the chicks hatch, she stays mainly on the nest until the young owls are fully feathered. When hatched, chicks are covered in light grey down, and have their eyes closed. The eyes do not open until the eighth day after hatching. They can fly at around 35 days.</p>
<p>By day, moreporks sleep in roosts. By night, they hunt a variety of animals -- mainly large invertebrates including scarab and huhu beetles, moths, caterpillars and spiders. They also take small birds and mice. They can find suitable food in pine forests as well as native forest. A morepork uses its sharp talons to catch or stun its prey, which it then carries away in its bill. Moreporks are clever hunters, and birds such as robins, grey warblers and fantails can end up as their prey. In the day, these small birds sometimes mob drowsy moreporks and chase them away from their roosts. They force the sleepy predators to search for a more peaceful spot.</p>
<p>Moreporks have proved to be ungracious hosts. Scientists trying to establish a population of plovers on Motuora island in New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf were mystified as to why only two birds survived out of 75 placed there. The culprits turned out to be five pairs of moreporks that ate or chased away the new arrivals.</p>
<p>Although moreporks are still considered to be relatively common, it is likely that numbers are in gradual decline due to predation and loss of habitat. As the female is a hole-nester, she is vulnerable to predators such as stoats and possums during the breeding season, and eggs and chicks will also be at risk from rats. The use of pesticides is another possible threat to the owls though not a direct one. As moreporks are at the top of the food chain, they could be affected by an accumulative poison by consuming prey that has ingested poison.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Department of Conservation is taking steps to ensure the preservation of New Zealand's only native owl. The department is involved in measuring the population of moreporks and has put transmitters on a number of birds to determine survival and mortality. As well as being New Zealand's only native owl, the morepork has symbolic and spiritual importance, so in monitoring the birds it is hoped that the morepork will continue to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>At dusk, the melancholy sound of the morepork can be heard in forests and parks as it calls to other moreporks and claims territory. Its Maori name (ruru) echoes its two-part cry. In the tradition of the Maori people of New Zealand, the morepork, or ruru, was often seen as a careful guardian. A number of sayings referred to the bird's alertness. As a bird of the night, it was associated with the spirit world. Moreporks were believed to act as messengers to the gods in the heavens, flying along spiritual paths in the sky. They were the mediums used to communicate with the gods. The occasional high, piercing call of the morepork signified bad news, but the lower-pitched and more common "ruru" call heralded good news.</p>`,

    title: 'Wood: a Valuable Resource in New Zealand\'s Economy',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> During the settlement of New Zealand by European immigrants, natural timbers played a major role. Wood was easily accessible and relatively cheap. A tradition of wooden houses arose, supported by the recognition that they were less likely to collapse suddenly during earthquakes, a not infrequent event in this part of the world. But in addition to demand from the domestic market, there was also a demand for forest products from overseas.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Early explorers recognised the suitability of the tall, straight trunks of the kauri for constructing sailing vessels. The kauri is a species of coniferous tree found only in small areas of the southern hemisphere. So from the early 1800s, huge amounts of this type of wood were sold to Australia and the UK for that purpose. For a period, the forestry industry was the country’s major export earner, but the rate of harvest was unsustainable and, by the beginning of the 20th century, indigenous timber exports were rapidly declining.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> From the 1940s, newly established plantations of an imported species of tree called radiata pine supplied timber and other wood products in increasing quantities. By the 1960s, plantation-grown timber was providing most of the country’s sawn timber needs, especially for construction. Today, less than two percent of timber is cut from indigenous forests, and almost all of that is used for higher-value end uses, such as furniture and fittings. As the pine industry developed, it became apparent that this type of wood was also well suited for many uses. It makes excellent pulp*, and is frequently used for posts, poles, furnishings and mouldings, particleboard, fibreboard, and for plywood and 'engineered' wood products. Pine by-products are used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and residues are consumed for fuel. This amazing versatility has encouraged the development of an integrated forest-products industry which is almost unique in the world.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Exporters of wood products have largely targeted the rapidly growing markets of South and East Asia and Australia. 80 percent of exports by value go to only five markets: Japan, Korea, China, the United States and Australia. The product mix remains heavily based on raw materials, with logs, sawn wood, pulp and paper comprising 75 percent of export value. However, finished wood products such as panels and furniture components are exported to more than 50 countries.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> In New Zealand itself, the construction industry is the principal user of solid wood products, servicing around 20,000 new house starts annually. However, the small size of New Zealand’s population (just over four million), plus its small manufacturing and remanufacturing base, limit the forestry industry’s domestic opportunities. For the last few years local wood consumption has been around only four million cubic metres. Accordingly, the development of the export market is the key to the industry’s growth and contribution to the national economy in decades to come.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> In 2004, forestry export receipts were about 11 percent of the country’s total export income, their value having increased steadily for ten years, until affected by the exchange fluctuations and shipping costs of recent years. The forestry industry is New Zealand’s third largest export sector, generating around $3.3 billion annually from logs and processed wood products. But it is generally agreed that it is operating well below its capacity and, with the domestic market already at its peak, almost all of the extra wood produced in future will have to be marketed overseas. That presents a major marketing challenge for the industry.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Although the export of logs will continue to provide valuable earnings for forest owners, there is broad acceptance that the industry must be based on value-added products in future. So the industry is investigating various processing, infrastructure and investment strategies with a view to increasing the level of local manufacturing before export. The keys to future success will depend on a variety of factors: better international marketing, product innovation, internationally competitive processing, better infrastructure and a suitable political, regulatory and investment environment. The industry claims that, given the right conditions, by 2025 the forestry sector could be the country’s biggest export earner, generating $20 billion a year and employing 60,000 people.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> One competitive advantage that New Zealand has is its ability to source large quantities of softwood from renewable forests. Consumers in several key wood markets are becoming more worried about sustainability, and the industry is supporting the development of national standards as well as the recognition of these internationally. However, New Zealand is not the only country with a plantation-style forestry industry. Chile, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Australia all have extensive plantings of fast-growing species (hardwood and softwood), and in the northern hemisphere, Scandinavian countries have all expanded their forests or controlled their use in the interests of future production.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> Finally, in addition to competition from other wood producers, New Zealand faces competition from goods such as wood substitutes. These include steel framing for houses. This further underlines the necessity for globally competitive production and marketing strategies.</p>

    title: 'Portrait of Bianca Sforza',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p>In 2010, a discovery shook the art world. A portrait of a young woman, purchased at a small auction in Switzerland for a modest sum, was identified by some experts as a previously unknown work by Leonardo da Vinci. The painting, known as La Bella Principessa, depicts Bianca Sforza, the illegitimate daughter of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. If authentic, it would not only expand da Vinci's already extraordinary oeuvre, but also change our understanding of his work during the late 15th century.</p>
<p>The portrait's journey into the limelight began when Canadian art collector Peter Silverman acquired it. At first glance, the delicate image seemed like a typical Renaissance portrait. However, certain details—the subtle shading of the sitter's face, the exquisite treatment of her hair, and the ethereal quality of the gaze—suggested a hand far more skilled than the German artist to whom it had previously been attributed. Suspecting something greater, Silverman enlisted the help of leading da Vinci expert Martin Kemp.</p>
<p>Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at Oxford University, had spent decades studying Leonardo's techniques. Upon examining the portrait, he was struck by several features. The sitter's hairstyle and costume matched Milanese fashion of the 1490s, and the fine lines of the drawing displayed Leonardo's characteristic sfumato technique—the subtle blending of tones without abrupt edges. Moreover, the use of vellum—a material made from calfskin—was consistent with Leonardo's known experiments during his Milanese period.</p>
<p>To bolster the claim of authenticity, scientific tests were conducted. Multispectral imaging revealed a series of faint fingerprint marks on the surface of the portrait. These prints, made in the paint layer before it dried, were compared with known fingerprints from Leonardo's notebooks. Astonishingly, there appeared to be a partial match, suggesting that Leonardo himself might have handled the work. Further analysis of the pigments confirmed that they were consistent with materials available in the late 15th century.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the attribution remains controversial. Critics argue that the portrait lacks the dynamism and innovation typical of Leonardo's other works. Carmen Bambach, curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is among those who remain unconvinced. She suggests that, while the portrait is of high quality, it could have been created by one of Leonardo's pupils or a talented contemporary imitator. Such doubts are not uncommon in the world of Old Master attributions, where connoisseurship and scientific evidence often clash.</p>
<p>Adding to the intrigue is the identity of the sitter. Historical records indicate that Bianca Sforza was married at a young age to Galeazzo Sanseverino, a prominent Milanese courtier. Tragically, she died shortly thereafter at the age of 14, possibly from childbirth complications. The portrait's subtle melancholy, combined with the youthful features of the sitter, supports the theory that it may have been commissioned to commemorate her short life. The debate surrounding La Bella Principessa reflects broader challenges in art authentication. As technology advances, tools such as carbon dating, digital microscopy, and chemical analysis provide new insights. Yet they rarely offer conclusive answers. In the case of this portrait, scientific findings, historical context, and stylistic analysis each tell part of the story, but none can definitively declare Leonardo's authorship.</p>
<p>For now, La Bella Principessa remains both a tantalising possibility and a symbol of art history's enduring mysteries. Whether or not it is confirmed as a work by Leonardo, the portrait has captured the imagination of scholars and the public alike. As Martin Kemp once remarked, "Even if we can never be 100 percent certain, the dialogue between art and science has brought us closer than ever before to understanding this beautiful, enigmatic figure."</p>`,

    title: 'The Pearl',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> The pearl has always had a special status in the rich and powerful all through the history. For instance, women from ancient Rome went to bed with pearls on them, so that they could remind themselves how wealthy they were after waking up. Pearls used to have more commercial value than diamonds until jewellers learnt to cut gems. In the eastern countries like Persia, ground pearl powders could be used as a medicine to cure anything including heart diseases and epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Pearls can generally be divided into three categories: natural, cultured and imitation. When an irritant (such as a grain of sand) gets inside a certain type of oyster, mussel, or clam, the mollusc will secrete a fluid as a means of defence to coat the irritant. Gradually, layers are accumulated around the irritant until a lustrous natural pearl is formed.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> A cultured pearl undergoes the same process. There is only one difference between cultured pearls and natural ones: in cultured pearls, the irritant is a head called ‘mother of pearl’ and is placed in the oyster through surgical implantation. This results in much larger cores in cultivated pearls than those in natural pearls. As long as there are enough layers of nacre (the secreted fluid covering the irritant) to create a gorgeous, gem-quality pearl; the size of the nucleus wouldn’t make a difference to beauty or durability.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> Pearls can come from both salt and freshwater sources. Typically, pearls from salt water usually have high quality, although several freshwater pearls are considered high in quality, too. In addition, freshwater pearls often have irregular shapes, with a puffed rice appearance. Nevertheless, it is the individual merits that determine the pearl’s value more than the sources of pearls. Saltwater pearl oysters are usually cultivated in protected lagoons or volcanic atolls, while most freshwater cultured pearls sold today come from China. There are a number of options for producing cultured pearls: use fresh water or sea water shells, transplant the graft into the mantle or into the gonad, add a spherical bead or do it nonbeaded.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> No matter which method is used to get pearls, the process usually takes several years. Mussels must reach a mature age, which may take up almost three years, and then be transplanted an irritant. When the irritant is put in place, it takes approximately another three years for a pearl to reach its full size. Sometimes, the irritant may be rejected. As a result, the pearl may be seriously deformed, or the oyster may directly die from such numerous complications as diseases. At the end of a 5- to 10-year circle, only half of the oysters may have made it through. Among the pearls that are actually produced in the end, only about 5% of them will be high-quality enough for the jewellery makers.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Imitation pearls are of another different story. The Island of Mallorca in Spain is renowned for its imitation pearl industry. In most cases, a bead is dipped into a solution made from fish scales. But this coating is quite thin and often wears off. One way to distinguish the imitation pearls is to have a bite on it. Fake pearls glide through your teeth, while the layers of nacre on the real pearls feel gritty.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Several factors are taken into account to evaluate a pearl: size, shape, Colour, the quality of surface and luster. Generally, the three types of pearls come in such order (with the value decreasing): natural pearls, cultured pearls and imitation pearls (which basically are worthless). For jewellers, one way to tell whether a pearl is natural or cultured is to send it to a gem lab and perform an X-ray on it. High-quality natural pearls are extremely rare. Japan’s Akoya pearls are one of the glossiest pearls out there, while the south sea water of Australia is a cradle to bigger pearls.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> Historically, the pearls with the highest quality around the globe are found in the Persian Gulf, particularly around Bahrain. These pearls have to be hand-harvested by divers with no advanced equipment. Unfortunately, when the large reserve of oil was discovered in the early 1930s, Persian Gulf’s natural pearl industry came to a sudden end because the contaminated water destroyed the once pristine pearls. In the present days, India probably has the largest stock of natural pearls. However, it is quite an irony that a large part of India’s stock of natural pearls are originally from Bahrain.</p>`,

Before 1,000 AD, the Chinese names ambergris as lung sien hiang, “dragon’s spittle perfume,” as they think that it was produced from the drooling of dragons sleeping on rocks at the edge of a sea. The Arabs knew ambergris as anbar who believed that it is produced from springs near seas. It also gets its name from here. For centuries, this substance has also been used as a flavouring for food.</p>
<p>During the Middle Ages, Europeans used ambergris as a remedy for headaches, colds, epilepsy, and other ailments. In the 1851 whaling novel <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Herman Melville claimed that ambergris was “largely used in perfumery.” But nobody ever knew where it really came from. Experts were still guessing its origin thousands of years later, until the long ages of guesswork ended in the 1720’s, when Nantucket whalers found gobs of the costly material inside the stomachs of sperm whales. Industrial whaling quickly burgeoned. By 20th century ambergris is mainly recovered from inside the carcasses of sperm whales.</p>
<p>Through countless ages, people have found pieces of ambergris on sandy beaches. It was named grey amber to distinguish it from golden amber, another rare treasure. Both of them were among the most sought-after substances in the world, almost as valuable as gold. (Ambergris sells for roughly $20 a gram, slightly less than gold at $30 a gram.) Amber floats in salt water, and in old times the origin of both these substances was mysterious. But it turned out that amber and ambergris have little in common. Amber is a fossilized resin from trees that was quite familiar to Europeans long before the discovery of the New World, and prized for jewelry. Although considered a gem, amber is a hard, transparent, wholly-organic material derived from the resin of extinct species of trees, mainly pines.</p>
<p>To the earliest Western chroniclers, ambergris was variously thought to come from the same bituminous sea founts as amber, from the sperm of fishes or whales, from the droppings of strange sea birds (probably because of confusion over the included beaks of squid) or from the large hives of bees living near the sea. Marco Polo was the first Western chronicler who correctly attribute ambergris to sperm whales and its vomit.</p>
<p>As sperm whales navigate in the oceans, they often dive down to 2 km or more below the sea level to prey on squid, most famously the Giant Squid. It’s commonly accepted that ambergris forms in the whale’s gut or intestines as the creature attempts to “deal” with squid beaks. Sperm whales are rather partial to squid, but seemingly struggle to digest the hard, sharp, parrot-like beaks. It is thought their stomach juices become hyper-active trying to process the irritants, and eventually hard, resinous lumps are formed around the beaks, and then expelled from their innards by vomiting. When a whale initially vomits up ambergris, it is soft and has a terrible smell. Some marine biologists compare it to the unpleasant smell of cow dung. But after floating on the salty ocean for about a decade, the substance hardens with air and sun into a smooth, waxy, usually rounded piece of nostril heaven. The dung smell is gone, replaced by a sweet, smooth, musky and pleasant earthy aroma.</p>
<p>Since ambergris is derived from animals, naturally a question of ethics arises, and in the case of ambergris, it is very important to consider. Sperm whales are an endangered species, whose populations started to decline as far back as the 19th century due to the high demand for their highly emollient oil, and today their stocks still have not recovered. During the 1970’s, the Save the Whales movement brought the plight of whales to international recognition. Many people now believe that whales are “saved”. This couldn’t be further from the truth. All around the world, whaling still exists. Many countries continue to hunt whales, in spite of international treaties to protect them. Many marine researchers are concerned that even the trade in naturally found ambergris can be harmful by creating further incentives to hunt whales for this valuable substance.</p>
<p>One of the forms ambergris is used today is as a valuable fixative in perfumes to enhance and prolong the scent. But nowadays, since ambergris is rare and expensive, and big fragrance suppliers that make most of the fragrances on the market today do not deal in it for reasons of cost, availability and murky legal issues, most perfumeries prefer to add a chemical derivative which mimics the properties of ambergris. As a fragrance consumer, you can assume that there is no natural ambergris in your perfume bottle, unless the company advertises this fact and unless you own vintage fragrances created before the 1980s. If you are wondering if you have been wearing a perfume with this legendary ingredient, you may want to review your scent collection. Here are a few of some of the top ambergris containing perfumes: Givenchy Amarige, Chanel No. 5, and Gucci Guilty.</p>`,

    title: 'Tulip Mania',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p><strong>A</strong> Centuries before anyone ever heard of high-tech stocks such as Qualcomm, CMGI, or Cisco Systems, a tulip in 17th century Holland caused quite the stir. The Semper Augustus was a tulip of extraordinary grandeur, with midnight blue petals topped by a pure white band and highlighted with crimson flares. For the Dutch, there were few things more valuable than the Semper Augustus tulips.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong> Around 1624, there were only a dozen specimens of the Semper Augustus. A man from Amsterdam owned all of the specimens. The man was offered 3,000 guilders in Dutch currency for just one bulb of the specimen. At the time, that was an absurd amount. The well-known Dutch painter Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn received only about half of that amount a few years later for his The Night Watch painting. Despite the apparently exorbitant offer for just one of his tulip bulbs, the Dutch man, whose name has been lost in history, declined the offer.</p>
<p><strong>C</strong> At that time, people wondered who was wackier, the man who refused to sell a tulip bulb for a fortune or the man who had offered to pay a fortune for just one bulb. This question was explored extensively by British journalist Mike Dash in his book, The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower and the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused. In his account of tulip mania, Dash details the history behind the buzzword and, in doing so, he presents a cautionary tale for modern-day investors, who are often inclined to load up on unproven and yet-to-be-profitable stocks, similar to the tulip mania that raged in Holland in the 17th century.</p>
<p><strong>D</strong> It should be pointed out that the Dutch were not the first people to go bonkers over tulips. Long before the first tulips ever bloomed in Europe, the Persians had already fallen in love with the beauty of the flower, and the rulers of the Ottoman Empire held it in the highest regard, dating back to a time around 1559. However, when the tulip finally arrived in Holland, the flower seemed to find an even more fertile ground, and not just from a horticultural standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> In the early 17th century, Holland was entering its Golden Age. Time, energy, and financial resources that had previously been used in fighting for Holland's independence from Spain were now available to be used for commerce. The city of Amsterdam was the hub of lucrative trade with the East Indies and a single voyage to the East Indies could result in substantial profits for the merchants involved in those activities. Those merchants often flaunted their success by building great estates, many landscaped with magnificent flower gardens.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong> Then along came the tulip. "It is impossible to comprehend the tulip mania without understanding just how different tulips were from every other flower known to horticulturists in the 17th century. The colours they exhibited were brighter than those of ordinary plants," Dash explains. Although the rarer tulips sometimes commanded higher prices, the bulbs for most ordinary tulips were sold by the pound for a modest price. Then, around 1630, a different type of tulip fancier appeared on the scene. Motivated by thoughts of great profits, these "florists" or professional tulip traders set out to find flower enthusiasts and speculators alike. But even as the number of tulip buyers grew quickly, the supply of tulip bulbs remained stagnant. It seems that the tulip became a foil in the supply squeeze: there was no quick fix to increase the quantity of available bulbs, as it takes seven years for a tulip to grow from a seed. Even though bulbs can produce two or three offshoots annually, the mother bulb lasts only a few years.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong> Tulip bulb prices continued to soar throughout the 1630s, as more speculators wedged into the market. Even people in other occupations wanted in on the tulip trading business. Weavers and farmers mortgaged their assets in order to get into the tulip market. In 1633, a farmhouse in Hoorn was sold in exchange for three rare bulbs. By 1636, the tulip trading business was flourishing so much that even "garbage" bulbs were being sold for hundreds of guilders. Eventually, a futures market for bulbs was even established. Tulip mania reached its zenith during the winter of 1636-1637, when some bulbs were known to be bought and sold up to ten times a day. Exemplifying this mania is the story of an auction that was held to benefit seven orphans whose only asset was 70 fine tulips left by their father. One of those bulbs, a rare Violetten Admirael van Enkhuizen bulb, sold for 5,200 guilders, an all-time record. All told, the 70 flowers from that auction brought in nearly 53,000 guilders.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> There is a saying that goes, "All good things must come to an end." That was certainly the case with the tulip market, which crashed quickly and spectacularly. It wasn't long after the above-mentioned orphan auction, when buyers refused to pay high asking prices at a routine bulb auction in Haarlem. In just a matter of days, the word of this auction spread all over the country, creating widespread panic among tulip traders and speculators. And, sure enough, the market for tulips crashed quickly thereafter. Tulips that had sold for 5,000 guilders only a few weeks before now fetched only 50 guilders.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> In comparing the tulip mania of the 17th century with the recent dot-com craze, there is one major difference: even at its height, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange never touched tulips. "The speculation in tulip bulbs always existed at the margins of Dutch economic life," Dash points out. As tulip trading was at the periphery of the Dutch economy, the fallout had little effect on the Dutch economy. Will we be able to say the same when Wall Street's current obsession with the dot-com craze finally runs its course?</p>`,

    title: 'Caral: an Ancient South American City',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p>Huge earth and rock mounds rise out of the desert of the Supe Valley near the coast of Peru in South America. These immense mounds appear simply to be part of the geographical landscape in this arid region squeezed between the Pacific Ocean and the Andes mountains. But looks deceive. These are actually human-made pyramids. Strong evidence indicates they are the remains of a city known as Caral that flourished nearly 5,000 years ago. If true, it would be the oldest known urban center in the Americas and among the most ancient in the world.</p>
<p>Research undertaken by Peruvian archaeologist Ruth Shady suggests that the 150-acre complex of pyramids, plazas and residential buildings was a thriving metropolis when Egypt's great pyramids were still being built. Though discovered in 1905, for years Caral attracted little attention, largely because archaeologists believed the structures were fairly recent. But the monumental scale of the pyramids had long interested Shady, who began excavations at the site in 1996, about 22 kilometers from the coast and 190 kilometers north of Peru's capital city of Lima.</p>
<p>Shady and her crew searched for broken remains of the pots and containers that most such sites contain. Not finding any only made her more excited; it meant Caral could be what archaeologists term pre-ceramic, that is, existing before the advent in the area of pot-firing techniques. Shady's team undertook the task of excavating Piramide Mayor, the largest of the pyramids. After carefully clearing away many hundreds of years' worth of rubble and sand, they identified staircases, walls covered with remnants of colored plaster, and brickwork. In the foundations, they found the remains of grass-like reeds woven into bags. The original workers, she surmised, must have filled these bags with stones from a nearby quarry and laid them atop one another inside retaining walls, gradually giving rise to the pyramid's immense structure. Shady had samples of the reeds subjected to radiocarbon dating and found that the reeds were 4,600 years old. This evidence indicated that Caral was, in fact, more than 1,000 years older than what had previously been thought to be the oldest urban center in the Americas.</p>
<p>What amazed archaeologists was not just the age, but the complexity and scope of Caral. Piramide Mayor alone covers an area nearly the size of four football fields and is 18 meters tall. A nine-meter-wide staircase rises from a circular plaza at the foot of the pyramid, passing over three terraced levels until it reaches the top. Thousands of manual laborers would have been needed to build such a project, not counting the many architects, craftsmen, and managers. Shady's team found the remains of a large amphitheater, containing almost 70 musical instruments made of bird and deer bones. Clearly, music played an important role in Caral's society. Around the perimeter of Caral are a series of smaller mounds and various buildings. These indicate a hierarchy of living arrangements: large, well-kept rooms atop pyramids for the elite, ground-level quarters for craftsmen, and shabbier outlying dwellings for workers.</p>
<p>But why had Caral been built in the first place? Her excavations convinced Shady that Caral once served as a trade center for the region, which extends from the rainforests of the Amazon to the high forests of the Andes. Shady found evidence of a rich trading environment, including seeds of the cocoa bush and necklaces of shells, neither of which was native to the immediate Caral area. This environment gave rise to people who did not take part in the production of food, allowing them to become priests and planners, builders and designers. Thus occupational specialization, elemental to an urban society, emerged.</p>
<p>But what sustained such a trading center and drew travelers to it? Was it food? Shady and her team found the bones of small edible fish, which must have come from the Pacific coast to the west, in the excavations. But they also found evidence of squash, sweet potatoes and beans having been grown locally. Shady theorized that Caral's early farmers diverted the area's rivers into canals, which still cross the Supe Valley today, to irrigate their fields. But because she found no traces of maize, which can be traded or stored and used in times of crop failure, she concluded that Caral's trade leverage was not based on stockpiling food supplies.</p>
<p>It was evidence of another crop in the excavations that gave Shady the best clue to Caral's success. In nearly every excavated building, her team discovered evidence of cotton seeds, fibers and textiles. Her theory fell into place when a large fishing net made of those fibers, unearthed in an unrelated dig on Peru's coast, turned out to be as old as Caral. 'The farmers of Caral grew the cotton that the fishermen needed to make their nets,' Shady speculates. 'And the fishermen gave them shellfish and dried fish in exchange for these nets.' In essence, the people of Caral enabled fishermen to work with larger and more effective nets, which made the resources of the sea more readily available, and the fishermen probably used dried squash grown by the Caral people as flotation devices for their nets.</p>`,

    title: 'The History of Tea',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p>The story of tea begins in China. According to legend, in 2737 BC, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree while his servant boiled drinking water, when some leaves from the tree blew into the water. Shen Nung, a renowned herbalist, decided to try the infusion that his servant had accidentally created. The tree was a Camellia sinensis, and the resulting drink was what we now call tea. It is impossible to know whether there is any truth in this story. But tea drinking certainly became established in China many centuries before it had even been heard of in the West. Containers for tea have been found in tombs dating from the Han Dynasty (206 BC—220 AD) but it was under the Tang Dynasty (618—906 AD), that tea became firmly established as the national drink of China.</p>
<p>It became such a favourite that during the late eighth century a writer called Lu Yu wrote the first book entirely about tea, the Ch'a Ching, or Tea Classic. It was shortly after this that tea was first introduced to Japan, by Japanese Buddhist monks who had travelled to China to study. Tea received almost instant imperial sponsorship and spread rapidly from the royal court and monasteries to the other sections of Japanese society.</p>
<p>So at this stage in the history of tea, Europe was rather lagging behind. In the latter half of the sixteenth century there are the first brief mentions of tea as a drink among Europeans. These are mostly from Portuguese who were living in the East as traders and missionaries. But although some of these individuals may have brought back samples of tea to their native country, it was not the Portuguese who were the first to ship back tea as a commercial import. This was done by the Dutch, who in the last years of the sixteenth century began to encroach on Portuguese trading routes in the East. By the turn of the century they had established a trading post on the island of Java, and it was via Java that in 1606 the first consignment of tea was shipped from China to Holland. Tea soon became a fashionable drink among the Dutch, and from there spread to other countries in continental western Europe, but because of its high price it remained a drink for the wealthy.</p>
<p>Britain, always a little suspicious of continental trends, had yet to become the nation of tea drinkers that it is today. Starting in 1600, the British East India Company had a monopoly on importing goods from outside Europe, and it is likely that sailors on these ships brought tea home as gifts. The first coffee house had been established in London in 1652, and tea was still somewhat unfamiliar to most readers, so it is fair to assume that the drink was still something of a curiosity. Gradually, it became a popular drink in coffee houses, which were as many locations for the transaction of business as they were for relaxation or pleasure. They were though the preserve of middle- and upper-class men; women drank tea in their own homes, and as yet tea was still too expensive to be widespread among the working classes. In part, its high price was due to a punitive system of taxation.</p>
<p>One unforeseen consequence of the taxation of tea was the growth of methods to avoid taxation—smuggling and adulteration. By the eighteenth century many Britons wanted to drink tea but could not afford the high prices, and their enthusiasm for the drink was matched by the enthusiasm of criminal gangs to smuggle it in. What began as a small time illegal trade, selling a few pounds of tea to personal contacts, developed by die late eighteenth century into an astonishing organised crime network, perhaps importing as much as 7 million lbs annually, compared to a legal import of 5 million lbs! Worse for die drinkers was that taxation also encouraged the adulteration of tea, particularly of smuggled tea which was not quality controlled through customs and excise. Leaves from other plants, or leaves which had already been brewed and then dried, were added to tea leaves. By 1784, the government realised that enough was enough, and that heavy taxation was creating more problems than it was words. The new Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, slashed the tax from 119 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Suddenly legal tea was affordable, and smuggling stopped virtually overnight.</p>
<p>Another great impetus to tea drinking resulted from the end of the East India Company's monopoly on trade with China, in 1834. Before that date, China was the country of origin of the vast majority of the tea imported to Britain, but the end of its monopoly stimulated the East India Company to consider growing tea outside China. India had always been the centre of the Company's operations, which led to the increased cultivation of tea in India, beginning in Assam. There were a few false starts, including the destruction by cattle of one of the earliest tea nurseries, but by 1888 British tea imports from India were for the first time greater than those from China.</p>
<p>The end of the East India Company's monopoly on trade with China also had another result, which was more dramatic though less important in the long term: it ushered in the era of the tea clippers. While the Company had had the monopoly on trade, there was no rush to bring the tea from China to Britain, but after 1834 the tea trade became a virtual free for all. Individual merchants and sea captains with their own ships raced to bring home the tea and make the most money, using fast new clippers which had sleek lines, tall masts and huge sails. In particular there was a competition between British and American merchants, leading to the famous clipper races of the 1860s. But these races soon came to an end with the opening of the Suez Canal, which made the trade routes to China viable for steamships for the first time.</p>`,

    title: 'The Life of Beatrix Potter',
    subtitle: 'The children\'s author and illustrator who created Peter Rabbit',
    passage: `<p>Beatrix Potter is one of the best-selling children's authors of all time. Her popular series of books that includes The Tale of Peter Rabbit was first published over one hundred years ago, and has never been out of print. Generations of children have enjoyed her many stories and illustrations, all of which celebrate the English lifestyle and rural landscape through the adventures of animals.</p>
<p>Born to a comfortable middle-class family in London in 1866, Potter spent much of her early life in her own company. She was educated in her parents' house by a governess and rarely saw her brother Bertram, who was sent to boarding school. Having little social contact with children of her own age, Potter began to be drawn into her own world of writing. When Beatrix was 15, she began to keep a diary written in a secret code of her own invention. Even Beatrix herself, when she read back over it in later life, found it difficult to understand. It was not until 15 years after her death that the code was cracked.</p>
<p>To the outside world Beatrix appeared a shy and reserved person, but in her diary she was able to express herself openly, and she was critical of the paintings of a number of artists of the day.</p>
<p>Potter was a naturally gifted artist, and with the aid of some art lessons she also learnt the technical side of drawing. During her childhood, she looked after many animals, such as rabbits, frogs, and even bats. She drew these animals throughout her childhood, gradually improving the standard of her work by sketching in museums. She was also interested in natural history. She would spend many hours drawing wildlife such as fungi and flowers, and at one time she had an ambition to develop this scientific interest. An uncle tried to help her become a student at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, but she was rejected because of her gender. Nevertheless, she achieved a measure of respect from the scientific establishment for her illustrations and contribution to mycology, the study of fungi.</p>
<p>When Potter was in her early 20s, her parents tried to arrange a partner for her to marry. Many likely suitors were found; however, Potter turned them all down. She was a fiercely independent woman, and she disliked the idea of being tied down to a domestic life that, at that time, consisted mostly of staying at home and bringing up children. Thus, unusually for British women of those times, she remained single and lived in her parents' home.</p>
<p>For several years, Potter tried to get her first children's book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published. Her initial attempts proved unsuccessful, but she persevered and eventually the book was accepted for publication by Frederick Warne & Company. The book finally came out in 1902, when Potter was 36, but the publishers did not expect it would sell many copies. In fact, the project was given to the youngest brother in the family company, Norman Warne, for his first project as a kind of test. Luckily, he proved to be a good choice as he warmed to both the book and Potter. He was determined to make a success of the book and developed a good working relationship with Potter as they pored over the individual details of the book. It was Norman who insisted that each drawing would be in colour. Potter insisted that the book remain small so that it would be easy for children to hold, and by the end of the year, 28,000 copies were in print.</p>
<p>The relationship between Warne and Potter blossomed, and eventually they became engaged. However, Potter's parents were unhappy about this because of his occupation. They eventually relented, but insisted the couple live apart for six months to give Potter time to change her mind. Tragically, before the wedding could take place, Warne developed pernicious anemia, a blood disease, and passed away. Potter was devastated and she wrote in a letter to his sister, Millie, 'He did not live long, but he fulfilled a useful, happy life. I must try to make a fresh beginning next year.'</p>
<p>After Warne's death, Potter moved to the Lake District in northern England. In 1905 she bought a small farm there, and for the next eight years she busied herself writing more books, some of which were based in or around the area. She lived there for the remainder of her life, but due to failing eyesight she was forced to stop writing children's books. Instead, she devoted her time to the breeding of sheep and helping with the conservation of farms in the district. Using proceeds from her very successful books and later her inheritance, Potter was able to buy many working farms. On her death, she left over 4,000 acres to the National Trust, an organisation which protects historical buildings and areas of countryside in England. It has meant that her beloved countryside is now accessible to many visitors.</p>`,

    title: 'Chilli Peppers',
    subtitle: '',
    passage: `<p>For thousands of years, humans have taken painful pleasure from adding chillies (also known as peppers or chilli peppers) to their food. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2015 indicated that a diet filled with spices - including chillies - was beneficial for health. The study, which was carried out by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, tracked the health of nearly half a million participants in China for several years. They found that participants who ate spicy food once or twice a week had a mortality rate 10% lower than those who ate spicy food less than once a week. Risk of death reduced still further for people who ate spicy food six or seven days a week. Chilli peppers were the most commonly used spice among the sample, and those who ate fresh chilli had a lower probability of death from cancer, heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>The health-promoting properties of chillies can be found in capsaicin, which is the odourless, colourless chemical compound that makes chillies hot. Inside a chilli there are yellow stalks that attach the seeds to its sides and in many types of chilli, this is the location of capsaicin, but there are several varieties where this is not the case. The heat of a chilli is measured in Scoville heat units, which is the number of times a sample of dissolved dried chilli must be diluted by its own weight in sugar water before it loses its heat. For a green bell pepper this is zero. But habanero peppers have a Scoville value of between 100,000 and 350,000. For pure capsaicin the figure is 16 million. Pure capsaicin can be bought on the internet, though its use as a food additive is banned in the European Union. The use of chilli peppers as weapons dates back to pre-Columbian times (before 1492), when, it is said, Mayans burned rows of them to create a stinging smokescreen to protect themselves from their enemies. The Aztecs also put chilli on their teeth to kill toothache pain, and the use of capsaicin as a pain reliever continues today.</p>
<p>Joshua Tewksbury, a natural historian at the University of Washington, thinks the burning sensation we experience when we come into contact with chillies is an evolutionary trick. We're not actually being damaged by the capsaicin the way we would be if we were touching a stove, but our brain thinks we are,' he says, adding that all mammals experience the same sensation but that birds do not. 'They can eat chillies like popcorn and they don't feel the heat." In this way, Tewksbury suggests, the plant evolved to repel animals that might crush its seeds with their teeth, but not ones that would help spread them.</p>
<p>Chillies also fight bacteria. This was of great value in the days before refrigeration, when, particularly in the tropics, people were vulnerable to bacteria that could harm them directly or cause their food to spoil. Chillies kill or inhibit 75% of such bacteria. That may just explain the spice's world-conquering success. Just two or three years after the explorer Christopher Columbus brought chilli seeds back to Europe from the New World in 1493, Portuguese merchants took the plants to Asia, where they would transform the cuisine. People in hot countries are said to use more chilli because it makes them generate a lot of sweat, which cools them down. But in 1998, researchers at Cornell University pointed out that the greater use of spices in countries such as India, Thailand and China was likely to be linked to the antibacterial function. By studying books filled with recipes from all over the world, the researchers found that spices including chilli were more likely to be used close to the equator, and were also used more in valleys with high levels of humidity than on high plateaux.</p>
<p>Capsaicin has even been suggested as a potential weight-loss tool. Research conducted by the University of Wyoming on mice that had been fed a high-fat diet found that the substance increased the metabolism of the animals, causing them to burn more energy and preventing weight gain. In another study, researchers at the University of Adelaide found that certain receptors that interact with capsaicin and are located inside the stomach play a role in sensing when you are full. Previous studies on humans seem to back the idea that eating spicy food may curb our appetite.</p>
<p>Capsaicin is a natural painkiller. Capsaicin creams and patches are available in chemists to ease pain. But it's only recently that we have come to understand how something that causes pain can ease it too. Capsaicin binds to the pain receptor TRPV1, which our brains also use to detect changes in temperature - that's why we think chillies are hot. But after being over-stimulated the neurons stop responding, killing the pain. This process involves the release of endorphins, which can give us a 'rush' not unlike the feeling we have when we have done some exercise. This may explain why some people believe that hot food is addictive.</p>`,
